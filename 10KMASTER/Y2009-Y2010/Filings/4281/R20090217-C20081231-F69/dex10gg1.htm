am sure you can also appreciate, it is important to the Company&#146;s future success that you, me and the other members of the senior executive leadership team are able to enhance our ability to increase shareholder value, and if necessary, to ease
transitions when it is in the best interest of the Company to do so. Accordingly, it is my pleasure to be able to provide you with this letter agreement (the &#147;Agreement&#148;) which sets forth the terms of an arrangement between you and the
Company concerning your continuing and post-employment obligations. This letter agreement supersedes and replaces in its entirety the letter agreement dated December&nbsp;23, 2004, between you and the Company. </FONT></P> <P
