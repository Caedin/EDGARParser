applied to the balance of the Participant&#146;s account on December&nbsp;31 of each Plan year, but prior to posting the current plan year&#146;s Benefit Credit. The average was determined by adding the LIBOR, as published in the Financial Times, as
of the last day of each month and dividing that sum by 12. Effective as of January&nbsp;1, 2002, the average annual LIBOR was the greater of a) the LIBOR as published in the Financial Times as of the last day of each month, divided by 12, or b)
5.5%. Effective as of August&nbsp;1, 2007, Earnings Credits with respect to a Participant whose Continuous Service was terminated prior to December&nbsp;31 of the plan year was applied to the Participant&#146;s account as of the end of the month in
which the participant&#146;s Continuous Service terminated, but prior to the posting of Benefits Credits as described in Section&nbsp;2.1. Earnings Credits for such Participant were the greater of i) the average LIBOR for the portion of the plan
year through the end of the month in which the Participant&#146;s Continuous Service terminated or ii) 5.5%, multiplied by a ratio that is the number of months the Participant was employed, including the month in which the Participant&#146;s
Continuous Service ends, over 12 months. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Effective July&nbsp;1, 2009, Earnings Credits will equal the U.S. prime rate in
