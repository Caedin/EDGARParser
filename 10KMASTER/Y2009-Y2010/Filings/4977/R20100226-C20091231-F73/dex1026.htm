STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2">Aflac Incorporated (hereinafter, the &#147;Corporation&#148;) established the position of Director Emeritus and adopted the Retirement Plan for Directors Emeritus (this &#147;Plan&#148;), effective as of
June&nbsp;13, 1989. The Plan is designed to provide retirement benefits for non-employee members (each, a &#147;Director&#148;) of the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;), and to help ensure the Corporation&#146;s continued
ability to retain highly qualified Directors. The Plan is now amended and restated in its entirety, effective as of the date set forth below, to read as follows: </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2"><U>Synopsis of Plan</U>. Upon voluntary retirement from the Board, or mandatory retirement from the Board after reaching age 75, an eligible Director shall become a Director Emeritus. The Corporation shall pay the
Director Emeritus (or his or her surviving spouse) retirement benefits, for a length of time equal to that Director&#146;s length of service as a non-employee Director of the Corporation. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2"><U>Section&nbsp;1. Eligibility</U>: Each Director who currently is a member of the Board and who currently is not an employee of the Corporation (or
any affiliate or subsidiary of the Corporation), and who was elected to the Board on or before May&nbsp;7, 2001, shall be eligible to participate in this Plan upon election to the Board. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2"><U>Section&nbsp;2. Directors Emeritus</U>: Upon a Director&#146;s voluntary retirement from the Board (as described in Section&nbsp;3), or when a
Director attains age 75, such Director shall cease all services to the Corporation and retire from the Board, at the conclusion of such Director&#146;s current term of office, and thereupon shall be appointed to the Emeritus Board. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2"><U>Section&nbsp;3. Voluntary Retirement</U>: In order to be eligible to become a Director Emeritus and to receive any benefits hereunder, as a result
of voluntary retirement, a Director must have attained age 55 <U>and</U> must have served a minimum of 5 years as a non-employee Director. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL"
SIZE="2"><U>Section&nbsp;4. Annual Benefit Amount</U>: The annual retirement benefits payable pursuant to this Plan to a retired Director shall be equal to the compensation (excluding committee fees) paid to the Director by the Corporation for his
or her service on the Board during the immediately preceding 12-month period, measured from the date of retirement. Such compensation shall include the retainer fee (up to $30,000) and regular Board meeting fees. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2"><U>Section&nbsp;5. Length of Service</U>: For purposes of determining eligibility for voluntary retirement under Section&nbsp;3 and calculation of the
term of payment under Section&nbsp;6, length of service shall be measured from the date a Director is elected to the Board or, in the case of an employee-Director who continues as a Director after ceasing to be an employee, the date such Director
ceased to be an employee of the Corporation (and affiliates and subsidiaries of the Corporation). Whole years only shall be used. In the event service is interrupted, all service shall be used, with the new starting point to be used to measure the
subsequent service. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:ARIAL" SIZE="2"><U>Section&nbsp;6. Time, Form and Term of Payment</U>: Payment of an eligible Director Emeritus&#146; annual
retirement benefit under this Plan shall commence during the calendar quarter next following the date that the Director &#147;separates from service&#148; as such term is used in Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and rules and regulations issued thereunder (&#147;Code Section&nbsp;409A&#148;), which will be the date that the Director retires from service on the Board as described in Section&nbsp;2. The annual Plan benefit shall continue to be paid quarterly,
with 25 percent of the Director&#146;s annual Plan benefit amount as described in Section&nbsp;4 to be paid during each calendar quarter during the term of payment. A Director&#146;s benefit shall be payable for a term equal to the Director&#146;s
years of service as computed pursuant to the terms of Section&nbsp;5, subject to the conditions of Sections&nbsp;7 and 10. </FONT></P>
