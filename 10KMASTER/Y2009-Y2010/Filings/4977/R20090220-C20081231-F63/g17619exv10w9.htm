<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>EXECUTIVE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective as of the 1st day of January, 2009, Aflac Incorporated (the &#147;Controlling Company&#148;)
hereby amends and restates the Aflac Incorporated Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (the
&#147;Plan&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>A.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Background</B></U>. The Plan was initially adopted effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1999, and
was subsequently amended. Effective January&nbsp;1, 2009, the Plan, as set forth in this document, is
intended and should be construed as a restatement and continuation of the Plan as previously in
effect.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>B.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Goal</B></U>. The Controlling Company desires to provide its designated key management
employees (and those of its affiliated companies that participate in the Plan) with an opportunity
(i)&nbsp;to defer the receipt and income taxation of a portion of such employees&#146; annual compensation,
and (ii)&nbsp;to the extent (if any) determined from time-to-time by the Controlling Company, to receive
additional deferred compensation provided by the respective employers.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>C.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Purpose</B></U>. The purpose of the Plan document is to set forth the terms and conditions
pursuant to which these deferrals may be made and to describe the nature and extent of the
employees&#146; rights to their deferred amounts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>D.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Type of Plan</B></U>. The Plan constitutes an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation
plan that benefits certain designated employees who are within a select group of key management or
highly compensated employees. It is intended that this Plan comply with the requirements of
Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
</DIV>

<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt"><U><B>STATEMENT OF AGREEMENT</B></U>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To amend and restate the Plan with the purposes and goals as hereinabove described, the
