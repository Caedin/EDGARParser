of the Company. However, if any one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is
considered to own more than 50&nbsp;percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the
stock of the Company, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not
considered to cause a Change in Control. An increase in the percentage of stock owned by any one
person, or persons acting as a group, as a result of a transaction in which the Company acquires
its stock in exchange for property will be treated as an acquisition of stock for purposes of this
subsection. This subsection applies only when there is a transfer of stock of the Company (or
issuance of stock of the Company) and stock in the Company remains outstanding after the
transaction.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, however, if a vested option is exercisable for stock

period of such leave does not exceed 6&nbsp;months, or, if longer, so long as the Participant retains a
right to reemployment with an Affiliate under an applicable statute or by contract. A leave of
absence constitutes a bona fide leave of absence only while there is a reasonable expectation that
the Participant will return to perform services for an Affiliate. If the period of leave exceeds 6
months and the Participant does not retain a right to reemployment under an applicable statute or
by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to terminate on the first date immediately
following such 6-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to
any medically determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in death or
can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 6&nbsp;months, where such impairment
causes the Participant to be unable to perform the duties of his or her position of employment or
any substantially similar position of employment, a 29-month period of absence shall be substituted

as an independent contractor pursuant to standards set forth in Treasury Regulations, to be treated
as having a Separation from Service. However, if a Participant provides services to Affiliates as
an employee and as a member of the Board of Directors, the services provided as a director are not
taken into account in determining whether the Participant has a Separation from Service as an

Facts and circumstances to be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited

continuation of salary and participation in employee benefit programs), whether similarly situated
service providers have been treated consistently, and whether the Participant is permitted, and
realistically available, to perform services for other service recipients in the same line of

not otherwise terminated employment as described in subsection (a)&nbsp;above, for purposes of this
subsection the Participant is treated as providing bona fide services at a level equal to the level
of services that the Participant would have been required to perform to receive the compensation
paid with respect to such leave of absence. Periods during which a Participant is on an unpaid
