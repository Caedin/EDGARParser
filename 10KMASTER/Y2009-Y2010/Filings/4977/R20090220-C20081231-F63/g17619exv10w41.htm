<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">as shown by the form attached hereto as Exhibit &#147;A&#148; and made a part hereof. If an increase in
compensation is entered on said Schedule and duly signed by the proper officers of Corporation and
by Employee, said entry shall constitute an amendment to this Employment Agreement as of the date
of said entry and shall supersede the base salary provided for in Paragraph&nbsp;5 and any other
increases in Employee&#146;s base salary previously entered on said Schedule.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;<U>Management Incentive Plan</U>. In addition to the base salary paid to Employee in

Corporation, beginning with the calendar year 2007, pay Employee, as performance bonus
compensation, an amount determined each year under Corporation&#146;s current Management Incentive Plan
(short-term Incentive Program) with a target level based on at least 37.5% of base salary in 2007,
42.5% in 2008 and 50% thereafter. Nothing in this paragraph shall preclude Employee from receiving
additional discretionary bonuses approved by the Chief Executive Officer or the Board.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;<U>Special Retirement Benefit</U>. Upon Employee&#146;s termination of employment with
Corporation, Corporation shall within a reasonable period of time after such termination, pay to

actually paid to employee as performance bonus compensation under corporation&#146;s Management
Incentive Plan for calendar years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, as set forth in Paragraph&nbsp;7.

Corporation and such additional employee benefits which the Compensation Committee of the Board
shall determine to be appropriate to Employee&#146;s duties and responsibilities including, without
limitation, reimbursement of legal and accounting expenses incurred by Employee in connection with
the preparation of his employment or other agreements with Corporation and any expenses for legal,
accounting or financial services incurred by Employee in connection with his employment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;<U>Stock option plans</U>. Employee shall be awarded restricted stock or stock options
to purchase Corporation&#146;s common stock under Corporation&#146;s Equity Award Plans as determined by the
Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The CEO will recommend that grants in the
following number of shares be granted to Employee: upon employment in 2007, 20,000 restricted
shares; in 2008, 40,000 stock options. (It should be understood, however, that said options can
only be granted by the Compensation Committee of the Corporation&#146;s Board of Directors, and that the
2007 grant cannot be made until after employment and during a &#147;stock trading window&#148; period, in
accordance with the Corporation&#146;s policy.)
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.&nbsp;<U>Working facilities and expenses</U>. Employee shall be provided with an office,

country clubs, civic clubs and business societies and associations as shall be appropriate in
facilitating Employee&#146;s job performance and in the best interest of Corporation. The Corporation
shall also pay all appropriate business liability insurance and any business licenses and fees
pertaining to the services rendered by Employee hereunder.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employee is encouraged and is expected, from time to time to incur reasonable expenses for

expense of Employee should be paid by Employee.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.&nbsp;<U>Vacation</U>. Employee shall continue to be entitled to his vacation time with pay
during each calendar year in accordance with Corporation&#146;s vacation policy for senior executive
employees. In addition, Employee shall be entitled to such holidays as Corporation shall recognize
for its employees generally.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;<U>Sickness and total disability</U>. Employee&#146;s absence from work because of sickness
or accident (not resulting in Employee becoming &#147;totally disabled,&#148; as that term is hereinafter
defined) shall not result in any adjustment in Employee&#146;s compensation or other benefits under this
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Employee become totally disabled as a result of sickness or accident and unable to
adequately perform his regular duties prescribed under this Agreement, his base salary (which shall
continue to be adjusted as provided for in Paragraph&nbsp;5), together with incentive bonuses under the
Corporation&#146;s Management Incentive Plan and his participation in Corporation&#146;s employee benefit
programs and retirement plan shall continue without reduction except as hereinafter provided,
during the continuance of such disability of a period not exceeding the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the end of
the term of this Agreement or any extension hereof or (2)&nbsp;a period of one and one-half (1-1/2)
years (547 calendar days) for each continuous disability. Payments pursuant to this paragraph 13
shall be reduced by any amounts paid to Employee during any such period of disability from time to
time under any disability programs, plans or policies maintained by Corporation, its subsidiaries
or affiliates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Employee&#146;s total disability continue for a period beyond the end of the term of this
Agreement or in excess of 547 calendar days, this Agreement shall, at the end of such period which
first occurs, be automatically terminated. If, however, prior to such time, Employee&#146;s total
disability shall have ceased and he shall have resumed the adequate performance of his duties
hereunder, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and Employee shall be entitled to
continue his employment hereunder and to receive his full compensation and other benefits as though
he had not been disabled; provided, however, unless Employee shall adequately perform his duties
hereunder for a continuous period of at least sixty (60)&nbsp;calendar days following a period of total
disability before Employee again becomes totally disabled, he shall not be entitled to start a new
547-day period under this paragraph, but instead may only continue under the remaining portion of
the original 547-day period of total disability. In the event Employee shall not adequately
perform his duties hereunder for a continuous period of at least sixty (60)&nbsp;calendar days following
a period of total disability, the running of the original 547-day period shall cease during the
time of Employee&#146;s adequate performance of his duties hereunder before Employee again becomes
totally disabled.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this Agreement, the term &#147;totally disabled&#148; or &#147;total disability&#148; shall
mean Employee&#146;s inability to adequately perform his executive and management duties hereunder on
account of accident or illness. It is understood that Employee&#146;s occasional sickness or other
incapacity of short duration may not result in his being or becoming &#147;totally disabled;&#148; however,
such illness or incapacity could constitute Employee&#146;s being or becoming &#147;totally disabled&#148; if such
illness or incapacity is prolonged or recurring.

Agreement, at any time, with or without &#147;good cause&#148; (&#147;good cause&#148; being hereinafter defined), by
giving at least sixty (60)&nbsp;days&#146; written notice to Employee of its intention to terminate
