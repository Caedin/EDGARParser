value or total voting power of the stock of Aflac. However, if any one person, or

of stock for purposes of this subsection. This subsection applies only when there
is a transfer of stock of Aflac (or issuance of stock of Aflac) and stock in Aflac
remains outstanding after the transaction.

has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent
acquisition by such person or persons) ownership of stock of Aflac possessing 30
percent or more of the total voting power of the stock of Aflac. However, if any
one person, or more than one person acting as a group, is considered to own more
than 50&nbsp;percent of the total fair market value or total voting power of the stock
of Aflac, the acquisition of additional stock by the same person or persons is not
considered to cause a Change in Control.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) A majority of members of Aflac&#146;s board of directors is replaced during
any 12-month period by directors whose appointment or election is not endorsed by
a majority of the members of Aflac&#146;s board of directors before the date of the
appointment or election.

has acquired during the 12-month period ending on the date of the most recent
acquisition by such person or persons) assets from Aflac that have a total gross
fair market value equal to or more than 40&nbsp;percent of the total gross fair market
value of all of the assets of Aflac immediately before such acquisition or
acquisitions. For this purpose, gross fair market value means the value of the
assets of Aflac, or the value of the assets being disposed of, determined without
regard to any liabilities associated with such assets.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) There is no Change in Control under this subsection (iv)&nbsp;when there is a
transfer to an entity that is controlled by the shareholders of Aflac immediately
after the transfer, as provided in this subsection. A transfer of assets by Aflac
is not treated as a change in the ownership of such assets if the assets are

which is owned, directly or indirectly, by a person described in subsection (3)
above.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) For purposes of this subsection (iv)&nbsp;and except as otherwise provided in
Treasury Regulations, a person&#146;s status is determined immediately after the
transfer of the assets. For example, a transfer to a company in which Aflac has
no ownership interest before the transaction, but that is a majority-owned
subsidiary of Aflac after the transaction, is not treated as a Change in Control.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) <U>Persons Acting as a Group</U>. Persons will not be considered to be
acting as a group solely because they purchase assets of the same corporation at
the same time with respect to subsection (iv), or solely because they purchase or
own stock of the same corporation at the same time with respect to subsections
(i), (ii)&nbsp;and (iii). However, persons will be considered to be acting as a group
if they are owners of a corporation that enters into a merger, consolidation,
purchase or acquisition of assets (with respect to subsection (iv)) or stock (with
respect to subsections (i), (ii)&nbsp;and (iii)), or similar business transaction with
Aflac. If a person, including an entity shareholder, owns stock in both
corporations that enter into a merger, consolidation, purchase or acquisition of
assets (with respect to subsection (iv)) or stock (with respect to subsections
(i), (ii)&nbsp;and (iii)), or similar transaction, such shareholder is considered to be
acting as a group with other shareholders in a corporation only to the extent of
the ownership in that corporation before the transaction giving rise to the change
and not with respect to the ownership interest in the other corporation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) <U>Attribution of Stock Ownership</U>. For purposes of this section,
Code Section 318(a) applies to determine stock ownership. Stock underlying a
vested option is considered owned by the individual who holds the vested option
(and the stock underlying an unvested option is not considered owned by the
individual who holds the unvested option). For purposes of the preceding
sentence, however, if a vested option is exercisable for stock that is not
substantially vested (as defined by Treasury Regulations Section&nbsp;1.83-3(b) and
(j)), the stock underlying the option is not treated as owned by the individual
who holds the option.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Acquisition of Additional Control. If any one person, or more than one
person acting as a group, is considered to effectively control Aflac (as
determined under subsections (ii)&nbsp;and (iii)), the acquisition of additional
control of Aflac by the same person or persons is not considered to cause a Change
in Control under subsections (i), (ii)&nbsp;or (iii).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">3.&nbsp;Section&nbsp;6(l) shall be amended by adding the following at the end thereof:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 4%">Awards and other grants or payments under the Plan shall be made, paid out and/or
modified in a manner intended to avoid resulting in the acceleration of taxation
(or the imposition of penalty taxation) under Section&nbsp;409A upon a Participant.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, with respect to any Awards
or other grants or payments that provide nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section&nbsp;409A, no payment to a &#147;specified employee&#148; (as such term is
defined in Section&nbsp;409A) upon separation from service (as such term is used in
Section&nbsp;409A), to the extent required under Section&nbsp;409A, shall be made before six
(6)&nbsp;months after the date on which the separation from service occurs. All
distributions under the Plan shall be made in the form of a single sum, unless
otherwise specified under the terms of the Plan or by the Committee at the time of
grant.
