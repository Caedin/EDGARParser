or accident (not resulting in Employee becoming &#147;totally disabled,&#148; as that term is hereinafter
defined) shall not result in any adjustment in Employee&#146;s compensation or other benefits under this
Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Employee become totally disabled as a result of sickness or accident and unable to

continue to be adjusted as provided for in Paragraph&nbsp;5), together with incentive bonuses under the
Corporation&#146;s Management Incentive Plan and his participation in Corporation&#146;s employee benefit
programs and retirement plan shall continue without reduction except as hereinafter provided,
during the continuance of such disability of a period not exceeding the earlier of (1)&nbsp;the end of
the term of this Agreement or any extension hereof or (2)&nbsp;a period of one and one-half (1-1/2)
years (547 calendar days) for each continuous disability. Payments pursuant to this paragraph 12
shall be reduced by any amounts paid to Employee during any such period of disability from time to
time under any disability programs, plans or policies maintained by Corporation, its subsidiaries
or affiliates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Employee&#146;s total disability continue for a period beyond the end of the term of this
Agreement or in excess of 547 calendar days, this Agreement shall, at the end of such period which
first occurs, be automatically terminated. If, however, prior to such time, Employee&#146;s total
disability shall have ceased and he shall have resumed the adequate performance of his duties
hereunder, this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect and Employee shall be entitled to
continue his employment hereunder and to receive his full compensation and other benefits as though
he had not been disabled; provided, however, unless Employee shall adequately perform his duties
hereunder for a continuous period of at least sixty (60)&nbsp;calendar days following a period of total
disability before Employee again becomes totally disabled, he shall not be entitled to start a new
547-day period under this paragraph, but instead may only continue under the remaining portion of
the original 547-day period of total disability. In the event Employee shall not adequately
perform his duties hereunder for a continuous period of at least sixty (60)&nbsp;calendar days following
a period of total disability, the running of the original 547-day period shall cease during the
time of Employee&#146;s adequate performance of his duties hereunder before Employee again becomes
totally disabled.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood that for purposes of this Paragraph&nbsp;12, Employee shall, upon his becoming

Employee under Corporation&#146;s Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP)&nbsp;and to provide a
survivor annuity to Employee&#146;s spouse under the Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purpose of this Agreement, the term &#147;totally disabled&#148; or &#147;total disability&#148; shall
mean Employee&#146;s inability to adequately perform his executive and management duties hereunder on
account of accident or illness. It is understood that Employee&#146;s occasional sickness or other
incapacity of short duration may not result in his being or becoming &#147;totally disabled;&#148; however,
such illness or incapacity could constitute Employee&#146;s being or becoming &#147;totally disabled&#148; if such
illness or incapacity is prolonged or recurring.

September&nbsp;12, 1994; and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the parties desire to amend said Employment Agreement to change Employee&#146;s minimum
target level bonus under AFLAC&#146;s Management Incentive Plan;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do amend said Employment Agreement as follows:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Paragraph&nbsp;7 entitled &#147; Management Incentive Plan &#148; shall be stricken in its entirety and
the following paragraph substituted therefor:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;In addition to the base salary paid to Employee in accordance with Paragraph&nbsp;5, Corporation
shall for each calendar year of Employee&#146;s employment by Corporation beginning with the calendar
year 1997, continue to pay Employee, as performance bonus compensation, an amount determined each
year under Corporation&#146;s current Management Incentive Plan (short-term Incentive Program) with a
target level based on fifty percent (50%) of base salary.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Except as specifically set forth in this Amendment, said Employment Agreement (as

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IN WITNESS WHEREOF, AFLAC has hereunto caused its name to be signed and its seal to be affixed
by its duly authorized officers, and Employee has hereunto set his hand and seal, all being done in
duplicate originals, with one original being delivered to each party as of the 2nd day of January,

when used in this Agreement shall mean that Employee separates from service
with Corporation and all affiliates, as defined in Code Section&nbsp;409A and
guidance issued thereunder (&#147;Section&nbsp;409A&#148;). As a general overview of Section

bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6)

months and the employee does not retain a right to reemployment under an
applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to
terminate on the first date immediately following such six (6)-month period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically
determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in
death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six
(6)&nbsp;months, where such impairment causes the employee to be unable to perform
the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar

both as an employee and an independent contractor, the employee must separate
from service both as an employee and as an independent contractor pursuant to
standards set forth in Treasury Regulations to be treated as having a
separation from service. However, if an employee provides services to
affiliates as an employee and as a member of the Board of Directors, the
services provided as a director are not taken into account in determining
whether the employee has a separation from service as an employee for purposes
of this Agreement.

employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and
circumstances indicate that the employer and the employee reasonably anticipate
that (A)&nbsp;no further services will be performed after a certain date, or (B)&nbsp;the
level of bona fide services the employee will perform after such date (whether
as an employee or as an independent contractor) will permanently decrease to
less than 50&nbsp;percent of the average level of bona fide services performed
(whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately
preceding thirty-six (36)-month period. Facts and circumstances to be
considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to,
whether the employee continues to be treated as an employee for other purposes
(such as continuation of salary and participation in employee benefit
programs), whether similarly-situated service providers have been treated
consistently, and whether the employee is permitted, and realistically
available, to perform services for other service recipients in the same line of
business. For periods during which an employee is on a paid bona fide leave of
absence and has not otherwise terminated employment as described in
subparagraph (1)&nbsp;above, for purposes of this subparagraph, the employee is
treated as providing bona fide services at a level equal to the level of
services that the employee would have been required to perform to receive the
compensation paid with respect to such leave of absence. Periods during which
an employee is on an unpaid bona fide leave of absence and has not otherwise
terminated employment are disregarded for purposes of this subsection
(including for purposes of determining the applicable thirty-six (36)-month
period).
