when used in this Agreement shall mean that Employee separates from service
with Corporation and all affiliates, as defined in Code Section&nbsp;409A and
guidance issued thereunder (&#147;Section&nbsp;409A&#148;). As a general overview of Section
409A&#146;s definition of &#147;separation from service&#148;, an employee separates from

bona fide leave of absence if the period of such leave does not exceed six (6)
months, or, if longer, so long as the employee retains a right to reemployment
with an affiliate under an applicable statute or by contract. A leave of

months and the employee does not retain a right to reemployment under an
applicable statute or by contract, the employment relationship is deemed to
terminate on the first date immediately following such six (6)-month period.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a leave of absence is due to any medically
determinable physical or mental impairment that can be expected to result in
death or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than six
(6)&nbsp;months, where such impairment causes the employee to be unable to perform
the duties of his or her position of employment or any substantially similar
position of employment, a twenty-nine (29)-month period of absence shall be
substituted for such six (6)-month period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 8%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) <U>Status Change</U>. Generally, if an employee performs services
both as an employee and an independent contractor, the employee must separate
from service both as an employee and as an independent contractor pursuant to
standards set forth in Treasury Regulations to be treated as having a
separation from service. However, if an employee provides services to
affiliates as an employee and as a member of the Board of Directors, the
services provided as a director are not taken into account in determining
whether the employee has a separation from service as an employee for purposes
of this Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 8%">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) <U>Termination of Employment</U>. Whether a termination of
employment has occurred is determined based on whether the facts and
circumstances indicate that the employer and the employee reasonably anticipate
that (A)&nbsp;no further services will be performed after a certain date, or (B)&nbsp;the
level of bona fide services the employee will perform after such date (whether
as an employee or as an independent contractor) will permanently decrease to
less than 50&nbsp;percent of the average level of bona fide services performed
(whether as an employee or an independent contractor) over the immediately
preceding thirty-six (36)-month period. Facts and circumstances to be
considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to,
whether the employee continues to be treated as an employee for other purposes
(such as continuation of salary and participation in employee benefit
programs), whether similarly-situated service providers have been treated
consistently, and whether the employee is permitted, and realistically
available, to perform services for other service recipients in the same line of
business. For periods during which an employee is on a paid bona fide leave of
absence and has not otherwise terminated employment as described in
subparagraph (1)&nbsp;above, for purposes of this subparagraph, the employee is
treated as providing bona fide services at a level equal to the level of
services that the employee would have been required to perform to receive the
compensation paid with respect to such leave of absence. Periods during which
an employee is on an unpaid bona fide leave of absence and has not otherwise
terminated employment are disregarded for purposes of this subsection
(including for purposes of determining the applicable thirty-six (36)-month
period).
