</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The Executive acknowledges that the Company is generally engaged in business throughout the

Employment Termination Date (as defined in the Plan), the Executive agrees that he will not, unless
acting with the prior written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, own, manage, control,
or participate in the ownership, management or control of, or be employed or engaged by, or
otherwise affiliated or associated with, as an officer, director, employee, consultant, independent
contractor or otherwise, any other corporation, partnership, proprietorship, firm, association, or
other business entity, or otherwise engage in any business which is engaged in any manner anywhere
in any business which, as of the Employment Termination Date, is engaged in by the Company, has
been reviewed with the Board for development to be owned or managed by the Company, and/or has been
divested by the Company but as to which the Company has an obligation to refrain from involvement,
but only for so long as such restriction applies to the Company; provided, however, that the
ownership of not more than 5% of the equity of a publicly traded entity shall not be deemed to be a
violation of this paragraph.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. The Executive also agrees that he will not, directly or indirectly, during the period
described in paragraph (1), induce any person who is an employee, officer, director, or agent of

associated in business with any present or former employee or officer of the Company, including
without limitation those who commence such positions with the Company after the Employment
Termination Date.

reasonable and necessary to protect and preserve the legitimate interests, properties, goodwill and
business of the Company, that the Company would not have entered into this Agreement in the absence
of such restrictions and that irreparable injury will be suffered by the Company should the
Executive breach the provisions of this Section. The Executive represents and acknowledges that
(a)&nbsp;the Executive has been advised by the Company to consult the Executive&#146;s own legal counsel in
respect of this Agreement, (b)&nbsp;the Executive has consulted with and been advised by his own counsel
in respect of this Agreement, and (c)&nbsp;the Executive

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">has had full opportunity, prior to execution of this Agreement, to review thoroughly this
Agreement with the Executive&#146;s counsel.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. The Executive further acknowledges and agrees that a breach of the restrictions in this
Agreement will not be adequately compensated by monetary damages. The Executive agrees that the
Company shall be entitled to (a)&nbsp;preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, without the necessity
of proving actual damages, or posting of a bond, (b)&nbsp;an equitable accounting of all earnings,
profits and other benefits arising from any violation of this Agreement, and (c)&nbsp;enforce the terms,
including requiring forfeitures, under other plans, programs and agreements under which the
Executive has been granted a benefit contingent on a covenant similar to those contained in this
Agreement, which rights shall be cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to
which the Company may be entitled. In the event that the provisions of this Agreement should ever
be adjudicated to exceed the limitations permitted by applicable law in any jurisdiction, it is the
intention of the parties that the provision shall be amended to the extent of the maximum
limitations permitted by applicable law, that such amendment shall apply only within the
jurisdiction of the court that made such adjudication and that the provision otherwise be enforced
to the maximum extent permitted by law.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If the Executive breaches his obligations under this Agreement, he agrees that suit may be
brought, and that he consents to personal jurisdiction, in the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania, or if such court does not have jurisdiction or will not accept
jurisdiction, in any court of general jurisdiction in Allentown, Pennsylvania; consents to the
non-exclusive jurisdiction of any such court in any such suit, action or proceeding; and waives any
objection which he may have to the laying of venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any
such court. The Executive also irrevocably and unconditionally consents to the service of any
process, pleadings, notices or other papers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Executive further agrees, covenants, and promises that he will not in any way communicate
the terms of this Agreement to any person other than his immediate family and his attorney and
financial consultant or when necessary to advise a third party of his obligations under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and Executive also agree that for a period
of two years following the Employment Termination Date, Executive will provide and that at all
times after the date hereof the Company may similarly provide, with prior written notice to
Executive, a copy of this Agreement to any business or enterprise (a)&nbsp;which Executive may directly
or indirectly own, manage, operate, finance, join, control or of which he may participate in the
ownership, management, operation, financing, or control, or (b)&nbsp;with which Executive may be
connected as an officer, director, employee, partner, principal, agent, representative, consultant,
or otherwise, or in connection with which Executive may use or permit to be used Executive&#146;s name.
Executive agrees not to disparage the name, business reputation, or business practices of the
Company or its subsidiaries or affiliates, or its or their officers, employees, or directors, and
the Company agrees not to disparage the name or business reputation of Executive.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8. The Executive hereby expressly acknowledges and agrees that (a)&nbsp;the provisions of the
