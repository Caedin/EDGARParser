limited due to certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the &#147;Code&#148;), which Plan was
thereafter amended and restated effective as of January&nbsp;1, 1987, October&nbsp;1, 1989, April&nbsp;1, 1998,

Company specifically reserves the right, at any time, to amend in whole or part any or all of the
provisions of the Plan and to suspend and/or terminate the Plan for whatever reason it may deem
appropriate; provided, however, that no such amendment, suspension, or termination shall reduce the
benefits payable to or accrued by a Participant as of the date of such amendment, suspension, or
termination, or eliminate the requirement to credit interest or Dividend Equivalents on the
Participant&#146;s Deferred Compensation Account, except as provided in Section&nbsp;7.3. Action to
terminate the Plan may be taken only by the Board of Directors of the Company, by its resolutions
duly adopted. Any other action referred to in this subsection and not determined by the Company&#146;s
general counsel to be in contravention of law may be taken by the Board or the Chairman of the
Board and evidenced by a resolution, certificate, amendment, new or revised Plan text, or other
writing; provided that only the Board may take any action that (A)&nbsp;materially increases aggregate
accrued benefits under the Plan, materially changes the benefit formula under the Plan, or
materially increases the cost of the Plan so long as persons designated by the Board as &#147;Executive
Officer&#148; for purposes of U.S. Securities laws participate in the Plan; or (B)&nbsp;would freeze benefit
accruals, materially reduce benefit accruals, or otherwise materially change the benefits under the
Plan; or (C)&nbsp;would constitute the exercise of power or function assigned to the Finance Committee
of the Board, the Plan Administrator, or the Claims Committee. The Chairman may delegate the
authority described in the preceding sentence in writing. If the Plan is terminated, all Deferral
Elections shall terminate automatically and all benefits previously accrued shall be payable at
such times as otherwise provided herein.

under the Plan is subject in any manner to anticipation, alienation, sale, transfer, assignment,
garnishment, pledge, encumbrance, or charge whether voluntary or involuntary, including in respect
of liability of a Participant or Beneficiary for alimony or other payments for the support of a
spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent, prior to actually being received by the
Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan, and any attempt to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer,
assign, garnish, pledge, encumber, or charge the same shall be void. No such benefits will in any
manner be liable for or subject to the debts, contracts, liabilities, engagements, or torts of any
Participant or Beneficiary. If any Participant or Beneficiary is adjudicated bankrupt or attempts
or purports to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, garnish, pledge, encumber, or charge
any benefit or payment under the Plan voluntarily or involuntarily, the Plan Administrator, in his
or her sole discretion, shall have the authority to cause the same or any part thereof then payable
to be held or applied to or for the benefit of such Participant, Beneficiary, spouse, children, or
other dependents, or any of them, in such manner and in such proportion as the Plan Administrator
shall determine.

respectively, under the Plan at such times as such benefits are payable under the terms of the
Plan. However, neither the Company nor any Employer nor the Plan gives the Participant or any
