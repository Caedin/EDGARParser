SIZE="2">The reserves for the properties that we reviewed were estimated by performance methods or the volumetric method. In general, reserves attributable to producing wells and/or reservoirs were estimated by performance methods such as decline
curve analysis, material balance and/or reservoir simulation which utilized extrapolations of historical production and pressure data available through October, 2009 in those cases where such data were considered to be definitive. In certain cases,
producing reserves were estimated by the volumetric method where there were inadequate historical performance data to establish a definitive trend and where the use of production performance data as a basis for the reserve estimates was considered
to be inappropriate. Reserves attributable to non- producing and undeveloped reserves included herein were estimated by the volumetric method, which utilized all pertinent well and seismic data available through October, 2009. </FONT></P> <P

San Juan and Black Warrior Basins. Many of Energen&#146;s properties in the Permian Basin are producing under secondary and enhanced recovery techniques. Some of Energen&#146;s reserves will be produced through horizontal wellbores; examples would

SIZE="2">To estimate economically recoverable oil and gas reserves, we consider many factors and assumptions including, but not limited to, the use of reservoir parameters derived from geological, geophysical and engineering data which cannot be
measured directly, economic criteria based on current costs and SEC pricing requirements, and forecasts of future production rates. Under the SEC regulations 210.4-10(a)(22)(v) and (26), proved reserves must be demonstrated to be economically
producible based on existing economic conditions including the prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined as of the effective date of the report. Energen has informed us that they have furnished us all of
the accounts, records, geological and engineering data, and reports and other data required for this investigation. In performing our audit of Energen&#146;s forecast of future production and income, we have relied upon data furnished by Energen
with respect to property interests owned, production and well tests from examined wells, normal direct costs of operating the wells or leases, other costs such as transportation and/or processing fees, ad valorem and production taxes, recompletion
and development costs, abandonment costs after salvage, product prices based on the SEC regulations, geological structural and isochore maps, well logs, core analyses, and pressure measurements. Ryder Scott reviewed such factual data for its
reasonableness; however, we have not conducted an independent verification of the data supplied by Energen. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman"

STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Reserves are those quantities of petroleum which are anticipated to be commercially recovered from known accumulations from a given date forward under defined conditions. All reserve estimates involve
some degree of uncertainty. The uncertainty depends chiefly on the amount of reliable geologic and engineering data available at the time of the estimate and the interpretation of these data. The relative degree of uncertainty may be conveyed by
placing reserves into one of two principal classifications, either proved or unproved. Unproved reserves are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves and may be further sub-classified as probable and possible reserves to denote
progressively increasing uncertainty in their recoverability. Under the SEC Regulations as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, or after January&nbsp;1, 2010, a company may optionally disclose estimated quantities of probable or possible oil and gas reserves
in documents publicly filed with the Commission. The SEC Regulations continue to prohibit disclosure of estimates of oil and gas resources other than reserves and any estimated values of such resources in any document publicly filed with the
Commission unless such information is required to be disclosed in the document by foreign or state law as noted in &#167;229.102 (5). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT

STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%" ALIGN="justify"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Reserves may be attributed to either natural energy or improved recovery methods. Improved recovery methods include all
methods for supplementing natural energy or altering natural forces in the reservoir to increase ultimate recovery. Examples of such methods are pressure maintenance, cycling, waterflooding, thermal methods, chemical flooding, and the use of
miscible and immiscible displacement fluids. Other improved recovery methods may be developed in the future as petroleum technology continues to evolve. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px" ALIGN="center"><FONT
