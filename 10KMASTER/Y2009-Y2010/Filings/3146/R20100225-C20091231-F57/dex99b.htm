reserves estimated by Energen Resources Corp. (ERC) from conventional formations for certain properties located in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico, north Louisiana and east Texas (herein referred to as &#147;Subject Areas&#148;) in accordance with
guidelines contained in the United States Securities and Exchange Commission Title 17, Code of Federal Regulations, Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting, Final Rule released January&nbsp;14, 2009 in the Federal Register (SEC regulations). Our
audit was completed on January&nbsp;15, 2010. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">A reserve audit is the process of reviewing certain of the pertinent facts
interpreted and assumptions made that have resulted in an estimate of reserves and/or reserves information prepared by others and the rendering of an opinion about the methodologies, data and thoroughness of the process that was used, the reserve
classification that was assigned and the reserve quantities that were estimated. This letter presents the results of our third party reserve audit based on the guidelines set forth under Section&nbsp;229.1202(a)(7) and (8)&nbsp;of the SEC
regulations. The estimated reserves shown in the following table represent ERC&#146;s estimated net Proved reserves attributable to the leasehold interests in certain properties owned by ERC as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. </FONT></P> <P

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas, which by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward. Reserve estimations are based on industry-accepted principles of engineering and evaluation that are predicated on
established scientific concepts. However, the application of such principles involves extensive judgment and assumptions and is subject to changes in performance data, existing technical knowledge, economic conditions and/or regulatory provisions.
Consequently, reserve estimates are inherently uncertain and will normally require some revisions in the future, particularly on new wells with little production history and for reserve categories other than Proved Developed Producing. The
restriction of production by mechanical, regulatory or market conditions also introduces uncertainty into reserve estimates and projections. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Since reserves have to be economically recoverable, it is necessary to determine the producing rate below which producing operations are no longer profitable (economic limit). Determining the economic
limit requires the application of oil and gas prices and operating cost data. The SEC regulations require the use of a constant price that is the unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for the twelve months prior to the
reporting date, except where the price is based on a contractual arrangement. ERC&#146;s states that their prices were determined according to the current SEC regulations. The lease./well operating costs used by ERC were the monthly averages for the
most recent twelve month available prior to the reporting date. The operating costs included only expenses directly applicable to the lease/well plus general and administrative costs that were appropriate to allocate back to the lease/well. We spot
checked operating costs to satisfy ourselves that they were calculated in a proper manner. In the economic calculations operating costs were held constant unless some scheduled change in operations dictated a change. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Because of the inherent uncertainties in determining reserve quantities, the reserves presented in this report are estimates only and should
not be construed a exact quantities. The actual volumes of oil and gas recovered could be more or less than the estimate reserves. The reserves reviewed in this audit are to be produced under primary recovery from conventional formation within the
Subject Areas. Our audit covered 100&nbsp;% of ERC&#146;s net Proved oil and gas reserves in the San Juan Basin, east Texas and north Louisiana. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We have accepted without independent verification the accuracy and completeness of the historical production and other data furnished by ERC with respect to ownership interest, oil and gas prices,
historical costs of operation and development, and any agreements relating to current and future operations of the properties and sales of production. If, however, in the course of our audit something came to our attention which called into question
the validity or sufficiency of any such information or data, we did not rely on such information or data until we had satisfactorily resolved our questions relating thereto. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">TSH&amp;A has used all methods and procedures necessary to prepare this report including a detailed review of major properties constituting
approximately 70% of the total Proved Developed Producing conventional reserves estimated by ERC in the Subject Areas as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. A review of the Proved Developed Nonproducing, Proved Developed Behind Pipe and Proved Undeveloped
reserves was conducted with ERC&#146;s engineers and geologists. This nonproducing/ undeveloped review covered not only the reserve estimations and development costs, but for the undeveloped locations the certainty that they would be drilled in the
near future. Drilling schedules, budgets and ERC&#146;s recent history of drilling proposed locations were investigated. No PUD locations were included in ERC&#146;s December&nbsp;31, 2009 reported reserves that were not scheduled to be drilled
within five years. All of the files and records for the leases/wells in the Subject Areas were available for our use. Performance and available plant accounting data were initially available through September 2009 at the start of our audit. Specific
leases/wells performance data were updated as our review progressed. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In general the reserves we reviewed were estimated by

federal conservation, pricing and environmental regulations that may apply. No consideration was given to potential environmental liabilities that may exist. It is our understanding that ERC&#146;s estimates of reserves do not include adjustments
for settlement of any potential gas volume and value imbalances which may have resulted from over- or under-production to ERC&#146;s interest. WE have not attempted to identify any interest revisions that might exist. </FONT></P> <P

utilized by ERC in the preparation of the reserve estimates are adequate and that ERC&#146;s reserve classifications conform to the SEC reserve definitions contained in 210.4-10(a). We have seen nothing unusual that would cause us to take exception

guidelines). Therefore it is our opinion that reserves set forth in this report fairly reflect the estimated net Proven reserves owned by the ERC in the Subject Areas. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT
