or officer of the Corporation be exculpated from any liability, to the Corporation or its
stockholders to which such director or officer might otherwise be subject by reason of &#147;disabling
conduct,&#148; as hereinafter defined. Accordingly, each determination with respect to the
permissibility of indemnification of a director or officer of the Corporation because such director
or officer has met the applicable standard of conduct shall include a determination that the
liability for which such indemnification is sought did not arise by reason of such person&#146;s
disabling conduct. The determination required by this Subsection 2(a) may be based on:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;a final decision on the merits by a court or other body before whom the action, suit or

conduct, or

conduct by: (A)&nbsp;the vote of a majority of a quorum of directors who are disinterested, non-party
directors; or (B)&nbsp;an independent legal counsel in a written opinion. In making such determination,
such disinterested, non-party directors or independent legal counsel, as the case may be, may deem
the dismissal for insufficiency of evidence of any disabling conduct of either a court action or an

such person was not liable by reason of disabling conduct.
