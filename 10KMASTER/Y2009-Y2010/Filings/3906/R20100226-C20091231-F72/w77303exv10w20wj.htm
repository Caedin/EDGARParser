DEFINITIONS</B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.01 <B>Account. </B>Account means the separate Account(s) which the Plan Administrator or the
Trustee maintains under the Plan for a Participant.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.02 <B>Account Balance or Accrued Benefit. </B>Account Balance or Accrued Benefit means the amount
of a Participant&#146;s Account(s) as of any relevant date derived from Plan contributions and from
Earnings.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.03 <B>Accounting Date. </B>Accounting Date means the last day of the Plan Year. The Plan
Administrator will allocate Employer Contributions and forfeitures for a particular Plan Year as of
the Accounting Date of that Plan Year, and on such other dates, if any, as the Plan Administrator
determines, consistent with the Plan&#146;s allocation conditions and other provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.04 <B>Adoption Agreement. </B>Adoption Agreement means the document executed by each Employer
adopting this Plan. References to Adoption Agreement within this basic plan document are to the
Adoption Agreement as completed and executed by a particular Employer unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise. An adopting Employer&#145;s Adoption Agreement and this basic plan document
together constitute a single Plan and Trust of the Employer. Each elective provision of the
Adoption Agreement corresponds (by its parenthetical section reference) to the section of the Plan
which grants the election. All &#147;Section&#148; references within an Adoption Agreement are to the basic
plan document. All &#147;Election&#148; references within an Adoption Agreement are Adoption Agreement
references. The Employer or Plan Administrator to facilitate Plan administration or to generate
written policies or forms for use with the Plan may maintain one or more administrative checklists
as an attachment to the Adoption Agreement or otherwise. Any such checklists are not part of the
Plan.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Prototype/Standardized Plan or Nonstandardized Plan. </B>Each Adoption Agreement offered under this
Prototype Plan is either a Nonstandardized Plan or a Standardized Plan, as identified in that
Adoption Agreement, under Rev. Proc 2005-16 &#167;&#167;4.10 and 4.11. The provisions of this Plan apply in
the same manner to Nonstandardized Plans and to Standardized Plans unless otherwise specified. If
the Employer maintains its Plan pursuant to a Nonstandardized Adoption Agreement or a Standardized
Adoption Agreement, the Plan is a Prototype Plan and all provisions in this basic plan which
expressly or by their context refer to a &#147;Volume Submitter Plan&#148; are not applicable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Volume Submitter Adoption Agreement. </B>A Volume Submitter Adoption Agreement for purposes of this
Volume Submitter Plan is subject to the same provisions as apply to a Nonstandardized Plan, except
as the Plan or Volume Submitter Adoption Agreement otherwise indicates. If the Employer maintains
its Plan pursuant to a Volume Submitter Adoption Agreement, the Plan is a Volume Submitter Plan and
all provisions in this basic plan which expressly or by their context refer to a &#147;Prototype Plan&#148;
are not applicable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Participation Agreement. </B>Participation Agreement, in the case of a Prototype Plan means the
Adoption Agreement page or pages executed by one or more Related Employers to become a
Participating Employer. In the case of a Volume Submitter Plan, Participation Agreement means the
Adoption Agreement page or pages executed by one or more Related Employers or, in the case of a
Multiple Employer Plan, by one or more Employers which are not Related Employers (see Section
12.02(C)) to become a Participating Employer.

form of a Volume Submitter Plan as defined in Section&nbsp;13.03 of Rev. Proc. 2005-16.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.06 <B>Annuity Contract</B>. Annuity Contract means an annuity contract that the Trustee purchases
with the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance. An Annuity Contract includes a QJSA, a QPSA and an
Alternative Annuity. If the Plan Administrator elects or is required to provide an Annuity
Contract, such annuity must be a Nontransferable Annuity and otherwise must comply with the Plan
terms.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Annuity Starting Date. </B>A Participant&#146;s Annuity Starting Date means the first day of the first
period for which the Plan pays an amount as an annuity or in any other form.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Alternative Annuity. </B>See Section&nbsp;6.03(A)(5).

provides that it may not be sold, assigned, discounted, pledged as collateral for a loan or
security for the performance of an obligation or for any purpose to any person other than the
insurance company. If the Plan distributes an Annuity Contract, the Annuity Contract must be a
Nontransferable Annuity.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.07 <B>Appendix. </B>Appendix means one of the Appendices to an Adoption Agreement designated as
&#147;A&#148;, &#147;B,&#148; &#147;C&#148; or &#147;D&#148; which are expressly authorized by the Plan and as part of
the Plan, are covered by the Advisory Letter or Opinion Letter.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.08 <B>Applicable Law. </B>Applicable Law means the Code, ERISA, USERRA, Treasury, IRS and DOL
regulations, rulings, notices, and other written guidance, case law and any other applicable
federal, state or local law affecting the Plan and which is binding upon the Plan or upon which the
Employer, the Plan Administrator, the Trustee and other Plan fiduciaries may rely in the operation,
administration and management of the Plan and Trust. If Applicable Law supersedes or modifies any
authority the Plan specifically references, the reference includes such Applicable Law.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.09 <B>Beneficiary. </B>Beneficiary means a person designated by a Participant, a Beneficiary or by
the Plan who is or may become entitled to a benefit under the Plan. A Beneficiary who becomes
entitled to a benefit under the Plan remains a Beneficiary under the Plan until the Trustee has
fully distributed to the Beneficiary his/her Plan benefit. A Beneficiary&#145;s right to (and the Plan
Administrator&#146;s or a Trustee&#145;s duty to provide to the Beneficiary) information or data concerning
the Plan does not arise until the Beneficiary first becomes entitled to receive a benefit under the
Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.10 <B>Code. </B>Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and includes applicable
Treasury regulations.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Uses and Context. </B>Any reference in the Plan to Compensation is a reference to the definition in
this Section&nbsp;1.11, unless the Plan reference, or the Employer in its Adoption Agreement, modifies
this definition. Except as the Plan otherwise specifically provides, the Plan Administrator will
take into account only Compensation actually paid during (or as permitted under the Code, paid for)
the relevant period. A Compensation payment includes Compensation paid by the Employer through
another person under the common paymaster provisions in Code &#167;&#167;3121 and 3306. In the case of a
Self-Employed Individual, Compensation means Earned Income as defined in Section&nbsp;1.11(J). However,
if the Plan must use an equivalent alternative compensation amount (pursuant to Treas. Reg.
&#167;1.414(s)-1(g)(1)(i) or other Applicable Law) in performing nondiscrimination testing relating to
Matching Contributions, Nonelective Contributions and other Employer Contributions (excluding
Elective Deferrals), the Compensation of such Self-Employed Individual will be limited to such
equivalent alternative compensation amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Base Definitions and Modifications. </B>The Employer in its Adoption Agreement must elect one of
the following base definitions of Compensation: W-2 Wages, Code &#167;3401(a) Wages, or 415
Compensation. The Employer may elect a different base definition as to different Contribution
Types. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement may specify any modifications thereto, for purposes
of contribution allocations under Article&nbsp;III. If the Employer fails to elect one of the
above-referenced definitions, the Employer is deemed to have elected the W-2 Wages definition.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;W-2 Wages</B>. W-2 Wages means wages for federal income tax withholding purposes, as defined
under Code &#167;3401(a), plus all other payments to an Employee in the course of the Employer&#146;s trade
or business, for which the Employer must furnish the Employee a written statement under Code
&#167;&#167;6041, 6051 and 6052, but determined without regard to any rules that limit the remuneration
included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or services performed (such as
the exception for agricultural labor in Code &#167;3401(a)(2)). The Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B may elect to
exclude from W-2 Compensation certain Employer paid or reimbursed moving expenses as described
therein.

account more than $200,000 (or such larger or smaller amount as the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue may prescribe pursuant to an adjustment made in the same manner as under Code &#167;415(d)) of
any Participant&#145;s Compensation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Employee under a 401(k) Plan may
make Elective Deferrals with respect to Compensation which exceeds the Plan Year Compensation
limitation, provided such Elective Deferrals otherwise satisfy the Elective Deferral Limit and
other applicable Plan limitations. In applying any Plan limitation on the amount of Matching
Contributions or any Plan limit on Elective Deferrals which are subject to Matching Contributions,
where such limits are expressed as a percentage of Compensation, the Plan Administrator may apply
the Compensation limit under this Section&nbsp;1.11(E) annually, even if the Matching Contribution

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(i)&nbsp;Paid and duties. </B>Each Hour of Service for which the Employer, either directly or
indirectly, pays an Employee, or for which the Employee is entitled to payment, for the performance
of duties. The Plan Administrator credits Hours of Service under this Paragraph (i)&nbsp;to the Employee
for the computation period in which the Employee performs the duties, irrespective of when paid;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(ii)&nbsp;Back pay. </B>Each Hour of Service for back pay, irrespective of mitigation of damages, to
which the Employer has agreed or for which the Employee has received an award. The Plan
Administrator credits Hours of Service under this Paragraph (ii)&nbsp;to the Employee for the
computation period(s) to which the award or the agreement pertains rather than for the computation
period in which the award, agreement or payment is made; and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(iii)&nbsp;Payment but no duties. </B>Each Hour of Service for which the Employer, either directly or

whether the employment relationship is terminated), for reasons other than for the performance of
duties during a computation period, such as leave of absence, vacation, holiday, sick leave,
illness, incapacity (including disability), layoff, jury duty or military duty. The Plan
Administrator will credit no more than 501 Hours of Service
under this Paragraph (iii)&nbsp;to an Employee on account of any single continuous period during which
the Employee does not perform any duties (whether or not such period occurs during a single
computation period). The Plan Administrator credits Hours of Service under this Paragraph (iii)&nbsp;in
accordance with the rules of paragraphs (b)&nbsp;and (c)&nbsp;of Labor Reg. &#167;2530.200b-2, which the Plan, by
this reference, specifically incorporates in full within this Paragraph (iii).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(iv)&nbsp;Crediting and computation. </B>The Plan Administrator will not credit an Hour of Service
under more than one of the above Paragraphs (i), (ii)&nbsp;or (iii). A computation period for purposes
of this Section&nbsp;1.31 is the Plan Year, Year of Service period, Break in Service period or other
period, as determined under the Plan provision for which the Plan Administrator is measuring an
Employee&#145;s Hours of Service. The Plan Administrator will resolve any ambiguity with respect to the
crediting of an Hour of Service in favor of the Employee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Method of Crediting Hours of Service. </B>The Employer must elect in its Adoption Agreement the
method the Plan Administrator will use in crediting an Employee with Hours of Service and the
purpose for which the elected method will apply.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Actual Method. </B>Under the Actual Method as determined from records, an Employee receives
credit for Hours of Service for hours worked and hours for which the Employer makes payment or for
which payment is due from the Employer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Equivalency Method. </B>Under an Equivalency Method, for each equivalency period for which the
Plan Administrator would credit the Employee with at least one Hour of Service, the Plan
Administrator will credit the Employee with: (a)&nbsp;10 Hours of Service for a daily equivalency; (b)
45 Hours of Service for a weekly equivalency; (c)&nbsp;95 Hours of Service for a semimonthly payroll
period equivalency; and (d)&nbsp;190 Hours of Service for a monthly equivalency.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;Elapsed Time Method. </B>Under the Elapsed Time Method, an Employee receives credit for
Service for the aggregate of all time periods (regardless of the Employee&#146;s actual Hours of
Service) commencing with the Employee&#146;s Employment Commencement Date, or with his/her Re-Employment
Commencement Date, and ending on the date a Break in Service begins. See Section&nbsp;2.02(C)(4). In
applying the Elapsed Time Method, the Plan Administrator will credit an Employee&#146;s Service for any
Period of Severance of less than 12-consecutive months and will express fractional periods of
Service in days.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(i)&nbsp;Elapsed Time &#150; Break in Service. </B>Under the Elapsed Time Method, a Break in Service is a
Period of Severance of at least 12 consecutive months. In the case of an Employee who is absent
from work for maternity or paternity reasons, the 12-consecutive month period beginning on the
first anniversary of the first date the Employee is otherwise absent from Service does not
constitute a Break in Service.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(ii)&nbsp;Elapsed Time &#150; Period of Severance. </B>A Period of Severance is a continuous period of time
during which the Employee is not employed by the Employer. The continuous period begins on the date
the Employee retires, quits, is discharged, or dies or if earlier, the first 12-month anniversary
of the date on which the Employee otherwise is absent from Service for any other reason (including
disability, vacation, leave of absence, layoff, etc.).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Maternity/Paternity Leave/Family and Medical Leave Act. </B>Solely for purposes of determining
whether an Employee incurs a Break in Service under any provision of this Plan, the Plan
Administrator must credit Hours of Service during the Employee&#146;s unpaid absence period: (1)&nbsp;due to
maternity or paternity leave; or (2)&nbsp;as required under the Family and Medical Leave Act. An
Employee is on maternity or paternity leave if the Employee&#146;s absence is due to the Employee&#146;s
pregnancy, the birth of the Employee&#145;s child, the placement with the Employee of an adopted child,
or the care of the Employee&#146;s child immediately following the child&#146;s birth or placement. The Plan
Administrator credits Hours of Service under this Section&nbsp;1.31(B) on the basis of the number of
Hours of Service for which the Employee normally would receive credit or, if the Plan Administrator
cannot determine the number of Hours of Service the Employee would receive credit for, on the basis
of 8 hours per day during the absence period. The Plan Administrator will credit only the number
(not exceeding 501) of Hours of Service necessary to prevent an Employee&#145;s Break in Service. The
Plan Administrator credits all Hours of Service described in this Section&nbsp;1.31(B) to the
computation period in which the absence period begins or, if the Employee does not need these Hours
of Service to prevent a Break in Service in the computation period in which his/her absence period
begins,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Compensation. </B>A Salary Reduction Agreement must specify the dollar amount of Compensation or
the percentage of Compensation the Participant wishes to defer. The Salary Reduction Agreement: (1)
applies only to Compensation for Elective Deferral allocation as the Employer elects in its
Adoption Agreement and which becomes currently available after the effective date of the Salary
Reduction Agreement; and (2)&nbsp;applies to all or to such Elective Deferral Compensation as the Salary
Reduction Agreement indicates, including any Participant elections made in the Salary Reduction
Agreement,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Additional Rules. </B>The Plan Administrator in the Plan&#146;s Salary Reduction Agreement form, or in a
Salary Reduction Agreement policy will specify additional rules and restrictions applicable to a
Participant&#146;s Salary Reduction Agreement, including but not limited to those rules regarding
changing or revoking a Salary Reduction Agreement. Any such rules and restrictions must be
consistent with the Plan and with Applicable Law.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.55 <B>Separation from Service/Severance from Employment. </B>Separation from Service means an event
after which the Employee no longer has an employment relationship with the Employer maintaining
this Plan or with a Related Employer. The Plan applies Separation from Service for all purposes
except as otherwise provided. For purposes of distribution of Restricted 401(k) Accounts, the
application of Post-Severance Compensation and top-heavy look-back period distributions, the plan
will apply the definition of Severance from Employment under EGTRRA
&#167;646 (as modified for Code &#167;415 purposes in applying the parent-subsidiary controlled group rules).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Predecessor Employer/Plan Service. </B>See Section&nbsp;1.44. If the Employer maintains (by adoption,
plan merger or Transfer) the plan of a Predecessor Employer, service of the Employee with the
Predecessor Employer is Service with the Employer. If the Employer maintained a Predecessor Plan,
for purposes of vesting Service, the Plan Administrator must count service credited to any Employee
covered under the Predecessor Plan. If the Employer in its Adoption Agreement elects to disregard
vesting Service prior to the time that the Employer maintained the Plan, the Plan Administrator
will treat a Predecessor Plan as the Plan for purposes of such election.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(C)&nbsp;Elective Service Crediting. </B>If the Employer does not maintain the plan of a Predecessor
Employer, the Plan does not credit Service with the Predecessor Employer, unless the Employer in
its Adoption Agreement (or in a Participation Agreement, if applicable) elects to credit designated
Predecessor Employer Service and specifies the purposes for which the Plan will credit service with
that Predecessor Employer. Unless the Employer under its Adoption Agreement provides for this
purpose specific Entry Dates, an Employee who satisfies the Plan&#146;s eligibility condition(s) by
reason of the crediting of predecessor service will enter the Plan in accordance with the
provisions of Article&nbsp;II as if the Employee were a re-employed Employee on the first day the Plan
credits predecessor service.

elective crediting of past Predecessor Employer Service to the period which does not exceed 5&nbsp;years
immediately preceding the year in which an amendment crediting such service becomes effective,
such credit must be granted to all Employees on a reasonably uniform basis, and the crediting must
otherwise comply with Treas. Reg. &#167;1.401(a)(4)-5(a)(3).

Severance of at least 12 consecutive months.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Two Year Eligibility</B>. If the Employer under the Adoption Agreement elects a two Years of

The Eligible Employee prior to his/her Entry Date and prior to first becoming eligible under any
plan of the Employer as described in Code &#167;219(g)(5)(A), including terminated plans, must file an
opt-out election in writing with the Plan Administrator on a form the Plan Administrator provides
for this purpose. An Employee&#146;s election not to participate, pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.06(A),
includes his/her right to make Elective Deferrals, Employee Contributions, Rollover Contributions
or Designated IRA Contributions, unless the Plan Administrator&#146;s opt-out form permits an Eligible
Employee to opt-out of specified Contribution Types prior to becoming eligible to participate in
such Contribution Type. A Participant&#146;s mere failure to make Elective Deferrals or Employee
Contributions is not an opt-out under this Section&nbsp;2.06(A).

the opt-out prior to the date of the Employer&#146;s execution of this Plan as a Restated Plan.

Contributions and Elective Deferrals based on the definition of Compensation under Section&nbsp;1.11 the
Employer elects in its Adoption Agreement for a particular Contribution Type. The Plan
Administrator in allocating such contributions must limit each Participant&#146;s Compensation to the
amount described in Section&nbsp;1.11(E).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Allocation Conditions. </B>The Plan Administrator will allocate Employer Contributions only to

may make Employer Contributions to a Profit Sharing Plan, to a 401(k) Plan or to a 401(m) Plan
(excluding Elective Deferrals or Employee Contributions) in the form of property instead of cash,
provided the contribution of property is not a prohibited transaction under Applicable Law. The
Employer may not make contributions in the form of property to its Money Purchase Pension Plan or
to its Target Benefit Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(G)&nbsp;Time of Payment of Contribution. </B>The Employer may pay to the Trust its Employer Contributions
for any Plan Year in one or more installments, without interest. Unless otherwise required by
applicable contract or Applicable Law, the Employer may make an Employer Contribution to the Plan
for a particular Plan Year at such time(s) as the Employer in its sole discretion determines. If
the Employer makes a contribution for a particular Plan Year after the close of that Plan Year, the
Employer will designate to the Plan Administrator and to the Trustee the Plan Year for which the
Employer is making the Employer Contribution. The Plan Administrator will allocate the
contribution accordingly.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(H)&nbsp;Return of Employer Contribution. </B>The Employer contributes to the Plan on the condition its

by mistake of fact or the amount of the Employer Contribution disallowed as a deduction under Code
&#167;404. The Trustee will not return any portion of the Employer Contribution under the provisions of
this Section&nbsp;3.01(H) more than one year after: (a)&nbsp;the Employer made the contribution by mistake of
fact; or (b)&nbsp;the IRS&#146;s disallowance of the contribution as a deduction, and then, only to the
extent of the disallowance.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Earnings. </B>The Trustee will not increase the amount of the Employer Contribution returnable

thereto.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;Evidence. </B>The Trustee may require the Employer to furnish the Trustee whatever evidence
the Trustee deems necessary to enable the Trustee to confirm the amount the Employer has requested
be returned is properly returnable under Applicable Law.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(I)&nbsp;Money Purchase Pension and Defined Benefit Plans. </B>If the Employer&#146;s Plan is a Money Purchase
Pension Plan and the Employer also maintains a defined benefit pension plan, notwithstanding the
Money Purchase Pension Contribution formula in the Employer&#146;s Adoption Agreement, the Employer&#146;s
required contribution to its Money Purchase Pension Plan for a Plan Year is limited to the amount
which the Employer may deduct under Code &#167;404(a)(7). If the Employer under Code &#167;404(a)(7) must
reduce its Money Purchase Pension Plan contribution, the Plan Administrator will allocate the
reduced contribution amount in accordance with the Plan&#146;s allocation formula.

Applicable Law otherwise provides and the Plan provisions (other than those relating to ongoing
permitted or required contributions) continue in effect until the Employer terminates the Plan. An
Eligible Employee will not become a Participant in a Frozen Plan.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Elective Deferrals (or
separately to Pre-Tax Deferrals or to Roth Deferrals, if applicable). Such Plan limitations are in
addition to those mandatory limitations imposed under Article&nbsp;IV and under Applicable Law. In
applying any such additional Plan limitation, the Plan Administrator will take
into account the Compensation for Elective Deferral purposes the Employer elects in the Adoption
Agreement. The Plan Administrator in the Salary Reduction Agreement form or in a Salary Reduction
Agreement policy (see Section&nbsp;1.54(C)) may specify additional rules and restrictions applicable to
Salary Reduction Agreements. The Employer in a SIMPLE 401(k) Plan may not impose any Plan limit on
Elective Deferrals except as provided under Code &#167;408(p). See Section&nbsp;3.05(C)(2) regarding limits
on Elective Deferrals under a safe harbor plan. The Employer may elect a Plan limit in its
Adoption Agreement, but if the Employer does not so elect, the Plan Administrator may establish or
change a Plan limit on Elective Deferrals from time to time by providing notice to the Participants
as is consistent with Applicable Law. Any such limit change made during a Plan Year applies only
prospectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Automatic Deferrals</B>. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement will elect whether to apply or not
apply the Automatic Deferral provisions of this Section&nbsp;3.02(B).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Definition of Automatic Deferral. </B>An Automatic Deferral is an Elective Deferral that
results from the operation of this Section&nbsp;3.02(B). Under the Automatic Deferral, the Employer
automatically will reduce by the Automatic Deferral Amount the Compensation of each Participant
affected by the Automatic Deferral under Section&nbsp;3.02(B)(3), except those Participants who timely
make a Contrary Election under Section&nbsp;3.02(B)(4).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Definition of Automatic Deferral Amount/Increases. </B>The Automatic Deferral Amount is the
amount of Automatic Deferral which the Employer elects in its Adoption Agreement. The Employer in
its Adoption Agreement may elect to apply a scheduled increase to the Automatic Deferral Amount. If
a Participant subject to the Automatic Deferral elected, before the Effective Date of the Automatic
Deferral, to defer an amount which is less than the Automatic Deferral Amount the Employer has
elected in its Adoption Agreement, the Automatic Deferral Amount under this Section&nbsp;3.02(B)
includes only the incremental amount necessary to increase the Participant&#146;s Elective Deferral to
equal the Automatic Deferral Amount, including any scheduled increases thereto.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;Employees or Participants subject to Automatic Deferral. </B>If the Employer elects to apply
the Automatic Deferral, the Employer in its Adoption Agreement will elect which Participants or
Employees are affected by the Automatic Deferral on the Effective Date thereof and which
Participants, if any, are not subject to the Automatic Deferral.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(4)&nbsp;Definition of Contrary Election. </B>A Contrary Election is a Participant&#146;s election made
after the Effective Date of the Automatic Deferral not to defer any Compensation or to defer an
amount which is more or less than the Automatic Deferral Amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(5)&nbsp;Effective Date of Contrary Election. </B>A Participant&#146;s Contrary Election generally is
effective as of the first payroll period which follows the Participant&#146;s Contrary Election.
However, a Participant may make a Contrary Election which is effective: (a)&nbsp;for the first payroll
period in which he/she becomes a Participant if the Participant makes a Contrary Election within a
reasonable period following the Participant&#146;s Entry Date and before the Compensation to which the
Election applies becomes currently available; or (b)&nbsp;for the first payroll period following the
Effective Date of the Automatic Deferral, if the Participant makes a Contrary Election not later
than the Effective Date of the Automatic Deferral. A Participant who makes a Contrary Election is
not thereafter subject to the Automatic Deferral or to any scheduled increases thereto, even if the
Participant later revokes or modifies the Contrary Election. A Participant&#146;s Contrary Election
continues in effect until the Participant subsequently changes his/her Salary Reduction Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(6)&nbsp;Automatic Deferral election notice. </B>If the Employer in its Adoption Agreement elects the
Automatic Deferral, the Plan Administrator must provide a notice (consistent with Applicable Law)
to each Eligible Employee which explains the effect of the Automatic Deferral and a Participant&#146;s
right to make a Contrary Election, including the procedure and timing applicable to the Contrary
Election. The Plan Administrator must provide the notice to an Eligible Employee a reasonable
period prior to that Employee&#146;s commencement of participation in the Plan subject to the Automatic
Deferral. The Plan Administrator also must provide Participants with the effective opportunity to
make a Contrary Election at least once during each Plan Year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(7)&nbsp;Treatment of Automatic Deferrals/Roth or Pre-Tax. </B>The Plan Administrator will treat
Automatic Deferrals as Elective Deferrals for all purposes under the Plan, including application of
limitations, nondiscrimination testing and distributions. If the Employer in its Adoption Agreement
has elected to permit Roth Deferrals, Automatic Deferrals are Pre-Tax Deferrals unless the Employer
in Appendix&nbsp;B elects otherwise.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Cash or Deferred Arrangement (CODA). </B>The Employer in its Adoption Agreement may elect to apply
the CODA provisions of this Section&nbsp;3.02(C). Under a CODA, a Participant may elect to receive in
cash his/her proportionate share of the Employer&#146;s cash or deferred contribution, in accordance
with the Employer&#146;s Adoption Agreement election. A Participant&#146;s proportionate share of the
Employer&#146;s cash or deferred contribution is the percentage of the total cash or deferred
contribution which bears the same ratio that the Participant&#146;s Compensation for the Plan Year bears
to the total Compensation of all Participants for the Plan Year. For purposes of determining each
Participant&#146;s proportionate share of the cash or deferred contribution, a Participant&#146;s
Compensation is his/her Compensation for Nonelective Contribution allocations (unless the Employer
elects otherwise in its Adoption Agreement) as determined under Section&nbsp;1.11, excluding any effect
the proportionate share may have on the Participant&#146;s Compensation for the Plan Year. The Plan
Administrator will determine the proportionate share prior to the Employer&#146;s actual contribution to
the Trust, to provide the Participants with the opportunity to file cash elections. The Employer
will pay directly to the Participant the portion of his/her proportionate share the Participant has
elected to receive in cash.

(&#147;Operational QMAC&#148;), irrespective of whether the Employer in its Adoption Agreement has elected to

discretion, will allocate the Operational QMAC, but will limit the allocation of any Operational
QMAC only to some or all NHCEs who are ADP Participants or ACP Participants under Sections&nbsp;4.11(A)

such Participants have not satisfied any eligibility conditions under Article&nbsp;II applicable to
Matching Contributions (including QMACs) or have not satisfied any allocation conditions under

number of eligible NHCEs, divided by the number 5 (rounded to the next lowest whole number if the
result is not a whole number), with a maximum of 25 allocation rates. For this purpose, an
&#147;allocation rate&#148; is the Participant&#146;s allocation under this Section&nbsp;3.04(B)(3)(b), divided by
Compensation for nondiscrimination testing under Section&nbsp;1.11(F). If, in any Plan Year, the number
of classifications the Employer has elected in the Adoption Agreement exceeds the maximum number of
allocation rates, the Employer will direct the Plan Administrator to allocate the Employer
Contribution in a manner that results in more than one classification receiving the same allocation
rate, and as is sufficient to bring the number of allocation rates within limits. If a Participant
during a Plan Year shifts from one classification to another, the Employer in a nondiscriminatory
manner will direct the Plan Administrator as to which classification the Participant will
participate in during that entire Plan Year; a Participant may not participate in more than one
classification during a Plan Year. The limitations of this Section&nbsp;3.04(B)(3)(b) apply if the
Employer&#146;s adoption of this Plan is a new Plan and in the case of a Restated Plan, these
limitations apply for Plan Years which begin after the date the Employer executes the Restated
Plan, For Plan Years up to and including the Plan year in which the Employer adopts the Plan as a
Restated Plan, the Employer will apply the Plan terms as in effect under the prior Plan.

Actuarial Factor is the factor in Table I of Appendix&nbsp;D to the Adoption Agreement or is the product
of the factors in Tables I and II of Appendix&nbsp;D to the Adoption Agreement if the Plan&#146;s Normal
Retirement Age is not age 65. If the Employer in its Adoption Agreement elects to use a table
other than the UP-1984 table, the Plan Administrator will determine a Participant&#146;s Actuarial

Agreement as a substituted Appendix&nbsp;D) and the Adoption Agreement elected interest rate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Effect/Remaining Terms/Testing Status. </B>The provisions of this Section&nbsp;3.05 apply to an electing
Employer notwithstanding any contrary provision of the Plan and all other remaining Plan terms
continue to apply to the Employer&#146;s Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan. An Employer which elects and
operationally satisfies the safe harbor provisions of this Section&nbsp;3.05 is not subject to the
nondiscrimination provisions of Section&nbsp;4.10(B) (ADP test). An electing Employer which provides for
an Enhanced Matching Contribution under Section&nbsp;3.05(E)(5) or for Additional Matching Contributions
under Section&nbsp;3.05(F) is subject to the nondiscrimination provisions of Section&nbsp;4.10(C) (ACP test),
unless the Employer elects in its Adoption Agreement to apply the ACP test safe harbor described in
Section&nbsp;3.05(G). If the Plan is a Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan, for purposes of testing in future
(non-safe harbor) Plan Years, the Plan in the safe harbor Plan Year is deemed to be using Current
Year Testing as to the ADP test and is deemed to be using Current Year Testing for the ACP test if
the Plan in the safe harbor Plan Year satisfies the ACP test safe harbor. If a Safe Harbor 401(k)
Plan is subject to Sections&nbsp;3.05(I)(1) or (2), the Plan in such Plan Year is deemed to be using
Current Year Testing for both the ADP and ACP tests.

allocation under this Section&nbsp;3.05, the following provisions apply:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Safe Harbor and Additional Matching allocation. </B>For purposes of allocating the Employer&#146;s
Safe Harbor Contributions and ACP test safe harbor Additional Matching Contributions, if any,
Compensation is limited as described in Section&nbsp;1.11(E) and Employer must elect under its Adoption
Agreement a nondiscriminatory definition of Compensation as described in Section&nbsp;1.11(F). The
Employer in its Adoption Agreement may not elect to limit NHCE Compensation to a specified dollar
amount, except as required under Section&nbsp;1.11(E).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Deferral allocation. </B>An Employer in its Adoption Agreement may elect to limit the type of
Compensation from which a Participant may make an Elective Deferral to any reasonable definition.
The Employer in its Adoption Agreement also may elect to limit the amount of a Participant&#146;s
Elective Deferrals to a whole percentage of Compensation or to a whole dollar amount, provided each
Eligible NHCE Participant may make Elective Deferrals in an amount sufficient to receive the
maximum Matching Contribution, if any, available under the Plan and may defer any lesser amount.
However, a Participant may not make Elective Deferrals in the event that the Participant is
suspended from doing so under Section&nbsp;6.07(A)(2), relating to hardship distributions or to the
extent that the allocation would exceed a Participant&#146;s Annual Additions Limit in Section&nbsp;4.05(B)
or the maximum Deferral Limit in Section&nbsp;4.10(A). If the Plan permits Roth Deferrals in addition
to Pre-Tax Deferrals, Elective Deferrals for purposes of Section&nbsp;3.05 includes both Roth Deferrals
and Pre-Tax Deferrals.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(D) &#147;Early&#148; Elective Deferrals/Delay of Safe Harbor Contribution. </B>If the Employer in its Adoption
Agreement elects any age and service eligibility requirements for Elective Deferrals that are less
than age 21 and one Year of Service (with one Year of Service being defined as completion of 1,000
Hours of Service during the relevant Eligibility Computation Period), the Employer in its Adoption
Agreement may elect to limit Safe Harbor Contributions to the Participants who have attained age 21
and who have satisfied the foregoing one Year of Service requirement. The Plan Administrator under
this Adoption Agreement election will apply the OEE rule under Section&nbsp;4.06(C) and will perform the
ADP (and ACP) tests as necessary for the Participants who are in the disaggregated plan which
benefits the Otherwise Excludible Employees. The disaggregated plan which benefits the Includible
Employees is a Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan under this Section&nbsp;3.05. However, nothing in this Section
3.05(D) affects the obligation of the Employer under Article&nbsp;X in the event that the Plan is
top-heavy, to provide a Top-Heavy Minimum Allocation for Non-Key Employee Participants in the
Elective Deferral component of the Plan who have not satisfied the age and service requirements
applicable to the Safe Harbor Contributions. Under this Section&nbsp;3.05(D), eligibility for Additional
Matching Contributions and for Nonelective Contributions which are not Safe Harbor Nonelective
Contributions is controlled by the Employer&#146;s Adoption Agreement elections and is not necessarily
limited to age 21 and one Year of Service as is the case for Safe Harbor Contributions. However,
as to ACP test safe harbor treatment for Additional Matching Contributions, see Section&nbsp;3.05(F)(3).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(E)&nbsp;Safe Harbor Contributions/ADP Test Safe Harbor. </B>An Employer which elects under this Section
3.05(E) to apply the safe harbor provisions, must satisfy the ADP test safe harbor contribution
requirement under Code &#167;401(k)(12) by making a Safe Harbor Contribution to the Plan. Except as
otherwise provided in this Section&nbsp;3.05, the Employer must make its Safe Harbor Contributions (and
any Additional Matching Contributions which will satisfy the ACP test safe harbor), no later than
twelve months after the end of the Plan Year to which such contributions are allocated. If the
Employer satisfies this Section&nbsp;3.05(E) and the remaining applicable provisions of Section&nbsp;3.05,
Elective Deferrals are not subject to nondiscrimination testing under Section&nbsp;4.10(B) (ADP test).
The Employer in its Adoption Agreement may elect to apply forfeitures toward satisfaction of the
Employer&#146;s required Safe Harbor Contribution.

may elect different allocation timing based on the forfeiture source (from Nonelective
Contributions or from Matching Contributions) or may elect to apply the same allocation timing to
all forfeitures. If the 401(k) Plan is subject to the ACP test and allocates any forfeiture as a
Matching Contribution, the following re-testing rules apply. If, under the Plan, the Plan
Administrator will allocate the forfeiture in the same Plan Year in which the forfeiture occurs,
the Plan Administrator will not re-run the ACP test. If the Plan Administrator allocates the
forfeiture in the Plan Year which follows the Plan Year in which the forfeiture occurs, the Plan
Administrator will include the allocated forfeiture in the ACP test for the forfeiture allocation
Plan Year. If the Plan allocates any forfeiture as a Nonelective Contribution, the allocation, in
the forfeiture allocation Plan Year, is subject to any nondiscrimination testing which applies to
Nonelective Contributions for that Plan Year.

Separation from Service solely for his/her benefit until a forfeiture occurs at the time specified
in Section&nbsp;5.07 or if applicable, until the time specified in Section&nbsp;7.07.

a forfeiture of any portion of his/her Account, even if the Participant otherwise is entitled to an
allocation of Employer Contributions and forfeitures in the forfeiture allocation Plan Year
described in Section&nbsp;3.07(B). If the forfeiting Participant is entitled to an allocation of
Employer Contributions and forfeitures in the forfeiture allocation Plan Year, the Plan

Employer&#146;s elections in its Adoption Agreement. The Employer may elect to limit any such forfeiture
allocation only to those Participants who were also participants in the merged plan, but in the
absence of such an election, all Participants who have satisfied any applicable allocation

may make a Rollover Contribution to the Trust. Before accepting a Rollover Contribution, the Plan
Administrator may require a Participant (or Eligible Employee) to furnish satisfactory evidence the
proposed transfer is in fact a &#147;rollover contribution&#148; which the Code permits an employee to make
to a qualified plan.

other practical problems for the Plan or Trust. The Plan Administrator also may accept the Rollover

associated therewith.

Treas. Reg. &#167;1.401(a)(4)-4.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Pre-Participation Rollovers. </B>If an Eligible Employee makes a Rollover Contribution to the Trust
prior to satisfying the Plan&#146;s eligibility conditions or prior to reaching his/her Entry Date, the
Plan Administrator and Trustee must treat the Employee as a limited Participant (as described in
Rev. Rul. 96-48 or in any Applicable Law). A limited Participant does not share in the Plan&#146;s
allocation of Employer Contributions nor Participant forfeitures and may not make Elective
Deferrals if the Plan is a 401(k) Plan, until he/she actually becomes a Participant in the Plan. If
a limited Participant has a Separation from Service prior to becoming a Participant in the Plan,
the Trustee will distribute his/her Rollover Contributions Account to him/her in accordance with
Section&nbsp;6.01(A).

salaries, professional fees, or other amounts derived from or received for personal services
actually rendered (including, but not limited to commissions paid salesmen, compensation for
services on the basis of a percentage of profits, commissions on insurance premiums, tips, and
bonuses) and includes earned income, as defined in Code &#167;401(c)(2) (reduced by the deduction the
Self-Employed Individual takes for contributions made to a self-employed retirement plan). For

held and invested: (1)&nbsp;in a separate trust for each Participant; (2)&nbsp;as a single trust holding all
Participant Designated IRA Contributions; or (3)&nbsp;as part of a single trust holding all of the
assets of the Plan. If the Plan Administrator establishes a single trust under clause (2)&nbsp;or (3),
the Plan Administrator must account separately for each Participant&#146;s Designated IRA Contributions
and for the Earnings attributable thereto. If the Designated IRA Contributions are invested in an
individual retirement annuity, the Plan Administrator may establish separate annuity contracts for
each Participant&#146;s Designated IRA Contributions or may establish a single annuity contract for all
Participants, with separate accounting for each Participant. If the Plan Administrator establishes
a single annuity contract, such contract must be separate from any other annuity contract under the
Plan. The Plan Administrator also may invest Designated IRA Contributions in any common or
collective fund under Sections&nbsp;8.02 or 8.09. The Trust provisions of Article&nbsp;VIII otherwise apply
to the investment of Designated IRA Contributions except that no part of such contributions may be
invested in life insurance contracts and a Participant may not borrow from a Designated IRA
Contributions Account or take such amounts into account in determining the maximum amount available
for a loan from the Participant&#146;s other Plan assets. The Plan Administrator or Trustee/Custodian
may not cause Designated IRA Contribution Accounts to be commingled with any non-Plan assets. Any
Designated IRA Contribution Account is established for the exclusive benefit of the affected
Participant and his/her Beneficiaries. No part of the Trust attributable to Designated IRA
Contributions may be invested in collectibles as described in Code &#167;408(m), except as may be
permitted under Code &#167;408(m)(3).

directly or through payroll withholding as the Plan Administrator may permit. At the time of the
Participant&#146;s contribution (or when the Designated IRA Contribution is withheld from payroll), the
Participant must designate the contribution as a Designated IRA Contribution and if applicable,
also must designate whether the contribution is traditional or Roth and whether the account is an
individual retirement account or an individual retirement annuity.

not participate, and who have never participated, in another qualified plan, individual medical
account (as defined in Code &#167;415(l)(2)), simplified employee pension plan (as defined in Code
&#167;408(k)) or welfare benefit fund (as defined in Code &#167;419(e)) maintained by the Employer, which
provides an Annual Addition.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Limitation. </B>The amount of Annual Additions which the Plan Administrator may allocate under this
Plan to a Participant&#146;s Account for a Limitation Year may not exceed the Annual Additions Limit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Actions to Prevent Excess Annual Additions. </B>If the Annual Additions the Plan Administrator
otherwise would allocate under the Plan to a Participant&#146;s Account for the Limitation Year would
exceed the Annual Additions Limit, the Plan Administrator will not allocate the Excess Amount, but
instead will take any reasonable, uniform and nondiscriminatory action the Plan Administrator
determines necessary to avoid allocation of an Excess Amount. Such actions include, but are not
limited to, those described in this Section&nbsp;4.01(C). If the Plan is a 401(k) Plan, the Plan
Administrator may apply this Section&nbsp;4.01 in a manner which maximizes the allocation to a
Participant of Employer Contributions (exclusive of the Participant&#146;s Elective Deferrals).
Notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision, the Plan Administrator, for the Limitation Year, may:
(1)&nbsp;suspend or limit a Participant&#146;s additional Employee Contributions or Elective Deferrals; (2)
notify the Employer to reduce the Employer&#146;s future Plan contribution(s) as necessary to avoid
allocation to a Participant of an Excess Amount; or (3)&nbsp;suspend or limit the allocation to a
Participant of any Employer Contribution previously made to the Plan (exclusive of Elective
Deferrals) or of any Participant forfeiture. If an allocation of Employer Contributions previously
made (excluding a Participant&#146;s Elective Deferrals) or of Participant forfeitures would result in
an Excess Amount to a Participant&#146;s Account, the Plan Administrator will allocate the Excess Amount
to the remaining Participants who are eligible for an allocation of Employer contributions for the
Plan Year in which the Limitation Year ends. The Plan Administrator will make this allocation in
accordance with the Plan&#146;s allocation method as if the Participant whose Account otherwise would
receive the Excess Amount is not eligible for an allocation of Employer Contributions. If the Plan
Administrator allocates to a Participant an Excess Amount, Plan Administrator must dispose of the
Excess Amount in accordance with Section&nbsp;4.01(E).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(D)&nbsp;Estimated and Actual Compensation. </B>Prior to the determination of the Participant&#146;s actual
Compensation for a Limitation Year, the Plan Administrator may determine the Annual Additions Limit
on the basis of the Participant&#146;s estimated annual Compensation for such Limitation Year. The Plan
Administrator must make this determination on a reasonable and uniform basis for all Participants
similarly situated. The Plan Administrator must reduce the allocation of any Employer Contributions
(including any allocation of forfeitures) based on estimated annual Compensation by any Excess
Amounts carried over from prior Limitation Years. As soon as is administratively feasible after the
end of the Limitation Year, the Plan Administrator will determine the Annual Additions Limit for
the Limitation Year on the basis of the Participant&#146;s actual Compensation for such Limitation Year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(E)&nbsp;Disposition of Allocated Excess Amount. </B>If a Participant receives an allocation of an Excess
Amount for a Limitation Year, the Plan Administrator will dispose of such Excess Amount in
accordance with this Section&nbsp;4.01(E).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Employee Contributions. </B>The Plan Administrator first will return to the Participant any
Employee Contributions (adjusted for Earnings) and will forfeit any Associated Matching
Contributions, to the extent necessary to reduce or eliminate the Excess Amount.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Elective Deferrals. </B>The Plan Administrator next will distribute to the Participant any
Elective Deferrals (adjusted for Earnings) and will forfeit any Associated Matching Contributions,
to the extent necessary to reduce or eliminate the Excess Amount. If a Participant who will receive
a distribution of an Excess Amount has, in the Plan Year for which the corrective distribution is
made, contributed both Pre-Tax Deferrals and Roth Deferrals, the Plan Administrator operationally
will determine the source(s) from which it will direct the Trustee to make the corrective
distribution. The Plan Administrator also may permit the affected Participants to elect the
source(s) from which the corrective distribution will be made. However, the amount of a corrective
distribution of an Excess Amount to any Participant from the Pre-Tax Deferral or Roth Deferral
sources under this Section&nbsp;4.01(E)(2) may not exceed the amount of the Participant&#146;s Pre-Tax
Deferrals or Roth Deferrals for the correction year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;Excess Amount remains/ Participant still covered</B>. If, after the application of Sections
4.01(E)(1) and (2), an Excess Amount still exists and the Plan covers the Participant at the end of
the Limitation Year, the Plan Administrator then will use the Excess Amount(s) to reduce future
Employer Contributions (including any allocation of forfeitures) under the Plan for the next
Limitation Year and for each succeeding Limitation Year, as is necessary, for the Participant. If
the Employer&#146;s Plan is a Profit Sharing Plan, a Participant who is an HCE may elect to limit
his/her Compensation for allocation purposes to the extent necessary to reduce his/her allocation
for the Limitation Year to the Annual Additions Limit and to eliminate the Excess Amount. The Plan
Administrator under this Section&nbsp;4.01(E)(3) will not distribute any Excess Amount(s) to
Participants or to former Participants.

that Participant&#146;s Account in the manner described in Section&nbsp;4.01(C), so the Annual Additions
under all of the Code &#167;415 Aggregated Plans for the Limitation Year will equal the Annual Additions
Limit.

Limitation on the basis of the Participant&#146;s estimated annual Compensation for such Limitation
Year. The Plan Administrator will make this determination on a reasonable and uniform basis for all
Participants similarly situated. The Plan Administrator must reduce the allocation of any Employer
Contribution (including the allocation of Participant forfeitures) based on estimated annual
Compensation by any Excess Amounts carried over from prior years. As soon as is administratively
feasible after the end of the Limitation Year, the Plan Administrator will determine the Combined

Additions attributable to a simplified employee pension as allocated first, followed by allocation
to a welfare benefit fund or individual medical account, irrespective of the actual allocation

must take into account any Elective Deferrals made by the HCE (and if used in the ADP test, any
QNECs and QMACs allocated to the HCE) under any other 401(k) Plan maintained by the Employer,
unless the Elective Deferrals are to an ESOP before the Final 401(k) Regulations Effective Date. If
the 401(k) Plans have different Plan Years, the Plan Administrator will determine the combined
Elective Deferrals on the basis of the Plan Years ending in the same calendar year. For Plan Years
beginning on or after the Final 401(k) Regulations Effective Date, if the 401(k) Plans have
different Plan Years, all Elective Deferrals made during the Plan Year will be aggregated.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator will not apply the aggregation rule of this
Section&nbsp;4.10(B)(5) to plans which may not be aggregated under Treas. Reg. &#167;1.401(k)-2(a)(3)(ii)(B).

plan for coverage or nondiscrimination purposes, the Employer must combine the 401(k) Plans to
determine whether the plans satisfy the ADP test. This aggregation rule applies to the ADR
determination for all ADP Participants (and ADP participants under the other plans), irrespective
of whether an ADP Participant is an HCE or an NHCE. An Employer may not aggregate: (a)&nbsp;plans with
different Plan Years; (b)&nbsp;a Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan with a non-Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan; (c)&nbsp;plans
which use different testing methods (Current Year Testing versus Prior Year Testing); or (d)&nbsp;any
other plans which must be disaggregated under Treas. Reg. &#167;1.401(k)-1(b)(4)(iv). For Plan Years
prior to the Final 401(k) Regulations Effective Date, the Employer may not aggregate an ESOP (or
the ESOP portion of a plan) with a non-ESOP plan (or non-ESOP portion of a plan). If the Employer
aggregating 401(k) Plans under this Section&nbsp;4.10(B)(6) is using Prior Year Testing, the Plan

Administrator has elected to include QMACs in the ADP test, any Excess Contributions are
attributable proportionately to Elective Deferrals and to QMACs in the ADP test allocated on the
basis of those Elective Deferrals. The Plan Administrator will reduce the amount of Excess
Contributions for a Plan Year distributable to an HCE by the amount of Excess Deferrals (as
determined in Section&nbsp;4.10(A)), if any, previously distributed to that Employee for the Employee&#146;s
Taxable Year ending in that Plan Year.

&#167;7508A), must distribute the Excess Contributions, as adjusted for Allocable Income under Section

ADR of the HCE(s) at the next highest ADR, including the ADR of the HCE(s) whose ADR the Plan
Administrator already has reduced (but not below the next highest ADR), and continuing in this

starting with the HCE(s) who has the highest dollar amount of Elective Deferrals, reducing his/her
Elective Deferrals (but not below the next highest dollar amount of Elective Deferrals), then, if

ending in the same calendar year. For Plan Years beginning on or after the Final 401(k) Regulations
Effective Date, if the 401(m) Plans have different Plan Years, all Aggregate Contributions made
during the Plan Year will be aggregated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Administrator will
not apply the aggregation rule of this Section&nbsp;4.10(C)(6) to plans which may not be aggregated

plan for coverage or nondiscrimination purposes, the Employer must combine the 401(m) Plans under
such plans to determine whether the plans satisfy the ACP test. This aggregation rule applies to
the ACR determination for all ACP Participants (and ACP participants under the other plans),
irrespective of whether an ACP Participant is an HCE or an NHCE. An Employer may not aggregate: (a)
plans with different Plan Years; (b)&nbsp;a Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan with a non-Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan;
(c)&nbsp;plans which use different testing methods (Current Year Testing versus Prior Year Testing); or
(d)&nbsp;any other plans which must be disaggregated under Treas. Reg. &#167;1.401(k)-1(b)(4)(iv). For Plan
Years prior to the Final 401(k) Regulations Effective Date, the Employer may not aggregate an ESOP
(or the ESOP portion of a plan) with a non-ESOP plan (or non-ESOP portion of a plan). If the
Employer aggregating 401(m) Plans under this Section&nbsp;4.10(C)(7) is using Prior Year Testing, the
Plan Administrator must adjust the NHCE Group ACP for the prior year as provided in Section

Contributions allocable as to Excess Contributions determined under the ADP test such that the Plan
Administrator distributes any Vested Excess Aggregate Contribution to reduce the amount of

Accounts and Additional Matching Contributions Accounts of all Participants who have at least one
Hour of Service in a Plan Year beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2001, regardless of when the Matching
Contributions were made. However, the Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B: (a)&nbsp;may elect to apply the top-heavy
vesting schedule only to Regular Matching Contributions and Additional Matching Contributions made
in Plan Years beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2001 and to the associated Earnings; and (b)&nbsp;may elect
to apply top-heavy vesting to the affected Matching Contributions for all Participants even if they
do not have one Hour of Service in a Plan Year beginning after December&nbsp;31, 2001. If the Employer
elects in its Adoption Agreement to apply a non-top-heavy schedule to Employer Contributions other
than Matching Contributions, the Employer must also elect in its Adoption Agreement, that in the
event that the Plan becomes top-heavy and then later becomes non-top-heavy, whether to return to
the elected non-top-heavy schedule commencing in the non-top-heavy Plan Year. If the Employer
elects a non-compliant top-heavy schedule, the Plan Administrator will apply a top-heavy schedule
under the Plan which most closely approximates the Employer&#146;s elected schedule (graded or cliff).

Contributions and Additional Matching Contributions.

Annuity Starting Date, the Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee to distribute a portion of
the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance to the Participant&#146;s surviving spouse in the form of a
QPSA, unless the Participant has a valid waiver election in effect. The Employer in its Adoption
Agreement will elect whether to apply the &#147;one-year marriage rule.&#148; If the Employer elects to apply
the one-year marriage rule, the QPSA benefit does not apply unless the Participant and his/her

which is payable for the life of the Participant&#146;s surviving spouse.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Modification of QPSA. </B>The Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B may elect a different percentage (more

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;Ordering rule. </B>The value of the QPSA is attributable to Employer Contributions, to Pre-Tax

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(4)&nbsp;Disposition of remaining balance. </B>The portion of the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance
not payable as a QPSA is payable to the Participant&#146;s Beneficiary, in accordance with the remaining
provisions of this Article&nbsp;VI.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(5)&nbsp;Surviving spouse elections. </B>If the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance which the Trustee
would apply to purchase the QPSA exceeds $5,000, the Participant&#146;s surviving spouse may elect to
have the Trustee commence payment of the QPSA at any time following the date of the Participant&#146;s
death, but not later than Section&nbsp;6.02 requires,
and may elect any of the methods of payment described in Section&nbsp;6.03, in lieu of the QPSA. In the
absence of an election by the surviving spouse, the Plan Administrator must direct the Trustee to
distribute the QPSA on the earliest administratively practicable date following the close of the
Plan Year in which the latest of the following events occurs: (a)&nbsp;the Participant&#146;s death; (b)&nbsp;the
date the Plan Administrator receives notification of or otherwise confirms the Participant&#146;s death;
(c)&nbsp;the date the Participant would have attained Normal Retirement Age; or (d)&nbsp;the date the
Participant would have attained age 62.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(6)&nbsp;QPSA notice/timing. </B>The Plan Administrator must provide a written explanation of the QPSA
to each married Participant within the following period which ends last: (a)&nbsp;the period beginning
on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 32 and ending on the last
day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age 34; (b)&nbsp;a reasonable period after an
Employee becomes a Participant; or (c)&nbsp;a reasonable period after Section&nbsp;6.04 of the Plan becomes
applicable to the Participant. A &#147;reasonable period&#148; described in clauses (b)&nbsp;and (c)&nbsp;is the period
beginning one year before and ending one year after the applicable event. If the Participant incurs
a Separation from Service before attaining age 35, clauses (a), (b), and (c)&nbsp;do not apply and the
Plan Administrator must provide the QPSA notice within the period beginning one year before and
ending one year after the Separation from Service. If the Participant thereafter returns to
employment with the Employer, the Plan Administrator will redetermine the applicable period. The
QPSA notice must describe, in a manner consistent with Treasury regulations, the terms and
conditions of the QPSA and of the waiver of the QPSA, comparable to the QJSA notice required under
Section&nbsp;6.04(A)(5).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(7)&nbsp;Waiver frequency and timing. </B>The Plan does not limit the number of times the Participant
may revoke a waiver of the QPSA or make a new waiver during the election period. The election
period for waiver of the QPSA ends on the date of the Participant&#146;s death. A Participant&#146;s QPSA
waiver election is not valid unless the Participant makes the waiver election after the Participant
has received the QPSA notice and no earlier than the first day of the Plan Year in which he/she
attains age 35. However, if the Participant incurs a Separation from Service prior to the first day
of the Plan Year in which he/she attains age 35, the Plan Administrator will accept a waiver
election as to the Participant&#146;s Account Balance attributable to his/her Service prior to his/her
Separation from Service. In addition, if a Participant who has not incurred a Separation from
Service makes a valid waiver election, except for the age 35 Plan Year timing requirement above,
the Plan Administrator will accept that election as valid, but only until the first day of the Plan
Year in which the Participant attains age 35.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(8)&nbsp;Spousal consent to waiver. </B>A Participant&#146;s QPSA waiver is not valid unless the
Participant&#146;s spouse (to whom the QPSA is payable) satisfies or is excused from the consent
requirements as described in Section&nbsp;6.04(A)(7), except the spouse need not consent to the form of
benefit payable to the designated Beneficiary. The spouse&#146;s consent to the waiver of the QPSA is
irrevocable, unless the Participant revokes the waiver election. The spouse also may execute a
blanket consent as described in Section&nbsp;6.04(A)(7)(a).
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Effect of Waiver. </B>If the Participant has in effect a valid waiver election regarding the QJSA
or the QPSA, the Plan Administrator must direct the Trustee to distribute the Participant&#146;s Vested
Account Balance in accordance with Sections&nbsp;6.01, 6.02 and 6.03.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(D)&nbsp;Loan Offset. </B>The Plan Administrator will reduce the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance by any
security interest (pursuant to any offset rights authorized by Section&nbsp;6.06) held by the Plan by
reason of a Participant loan, to determine the value of the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance
distributable in the form of a QJSA or QPSA, provided the loan satisfied the spousal consent
requirement described in Section&nbsp;7.06(D).

alternate payee prior to the Participant&#146;s attainment of earliest retirement age is available only

and each alternate payee, in writing, of the Plan Administrator&#146;s determination. The Plan
Administrator must provide notice under this Section&nbsp;6.05(C)(1) by mailing to the individual&#146;s

order is a QDRO within 18&nbsp;months of the date amounts first are payable following receipt of the
domestic relations order, the Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee to distribute the payable
amounts in accordance with the QDRO. If the Plan Administrator does not make its determination of
the qualified status of the order within the 18-month determination period, the Plan Administrator
will direct the Trustee to distribute the payable amounts in the manner the Plan would distribute
if the order did not exist and will apply the order prospectively if the Plan Administrator later
determines the order is a QDRO.

the Participant&#146;s spouse, or for any of the Participant&#146;s dependents that would be deductible under
Code &#167;213(d) (determined without regard to whether the expenses exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross
income); (b)&nbsp;costs directly related to the purchase (excluding mortgage payments) of a principal
residence of the Participant; (c)&nbsp;payment of post-secondary education tuition and related
educational fees (including room and board), for the next 12-month period, for the Participant, for
the Participant&#146;s spouse, for the Participant&#146;s children, or for any of the Participant&#146;s

his/her principal residence or the foreclosure of the mortgage on the Participant&#146;s principal
residence; (e)&nbsp;payments for the funeral or burial expenses for the Participant&#146;s deceased parent,
spouse, child, or dependent; or (f)&nbsp;expenses to repair damage to the Participant&#146;s principal
residence that would qualify for a casualty loss deduction under Code &#167;165 (determined without
regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income). Clauses (e)&nbsp;and (f)&nbsp;only apply as
of the Final 401(k) Regulations Effective Date. As used in this Section&nbsp;6.07(A)(1), the term
&#147;dependent&#148; means a dependent as defined in Code &#167;152 but for Taxable Years beginning after 2004 as

6-month period (or any longer period the Plan Administrator may specify in a hardship distribution
policy) following the date of his/her hardship distribution; (b)&nbsp;the distribution may not exceed
the amount of the Participant&#146;s immediate and heavy financial need (including any amounts necessary
to pay any federal, state or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from
the distribution); and (c)&nbsp;the Participant must have obtained all distributions (including
distribution of Code &#167;404(k) ESOP dividends), other than hardship distributions, and all nontaxable
loans (determined at the time of the loan) currently available under the Plan and all other plans
(described below) maintained by the Employer. &#147;Other plans&#148; for purposes of clauses (a)&nbsp;and (c)
means all other qualified plans and all nonqualified plans of deferred compensation maintained by
the Employer including a cash or deferred arrangement that is part of a cafeteria plan under Code
&#167;125 (but excluding the mandatory employee contribution portion of a Defined Benefit Plan or a
health or welfare benefit plan, including one that is part of a cafeteria plan). For purposes of

distribution is a distribution on account of an immediate and heavy financial need. The
distribution cannot exceed the amount necessary to satisfy the need (including any amounts
necessary to pay any federal, state, or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to
result from the distribution). The Plan will not make a non-safe harbor hardship distribution if
the Participant may relieve the need from other resources that are reasonably available to the
Participant. The Plan Administrator will administer a hardship distribution under this Section
6.07(B) in accordance with Treas. Reg. &#167;1.401(k)-1(d)(3)(iv), but excluding paragraph (E)&nbsp;thereof.

Section&nbsp;6.07(A)(1)), that the distribution satisfies Section&nbsp;6.07(B) and/or that the distribution
satisfies clause (b)&nbsp;under 6.07(A)(2).

6.07(A)(2) or 6.07(B) need not take counterproductive actions as would increase the financial need.
Such actions include, but are not limited to, being required to first take a Participant loan to

Elective Deferrals as of the hardship distribution date, reduced by the amount of any Elective
Deferrals previously distributed to the Participant based on hardship or otherwise. QMACs and
QNECs, and any Earnings on such contributions, and Earnings on the Participant&#146;s Elective
Deferrals, credited as of December&nbsp;31, 1988 (collectively, &#147;grandfathered amounts&#148;), increase the
amount of the maximum available hardship distribution only if the Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B elects to
include such amounts. The restrictions of this Section&nbsp;6.07(E) do not apply to hardship
distributions from Nonelective Contributions, Regular Matching Contributions or Additional
Matching Contributions and such distributions also may include Earnings on such Accounts. No
hardship distribution is available from Safe harbor Contribution Accounts.

at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have any portion of his/her
Eligible Rollover Distribution from the Plan paid directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan specified
by the Participant in a Direct Rollover. For purposes of this Section&nbsp;6.08, a Participant includes
as to their respective interests, a Participant&#146;s surviving spouse and the
Participant&#146;s spouse or former spouse who is an alternate payee under a QDRO.

explaining to the distributee the rollover option, the applicability of mandatory 20% federal
withholding to any amount not directly rolled over, and the recipient&#146;s right to roll over the
distribution within 60&nbsp;days after the date of receipt of the distribution (&#147;rollover notice&#148;). If
applicable, the rollover notice also must explain the availability of income averaging and the
exclusion of net unrealized appreciation. A recipient of an Eligible Rollover Distribution (whether
he/she elects a Direct Rollover or elects to receive the distribution), also may elect to receive
distribution at any administratively practicable time which is earlier than 30&nbsp;days (but more than
7&nbsp;days if Section&nbsp;6.04 applies) following receipt of the rollover notice.

Retirement Age. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement will elect whether to apply this Section
6.08(D) to a specified amount or will apply this Section only to such Mandatory Distributions which
exceed $1,000. In the event of any Mandatory Distribution subject to this Section&nbsp;6.08(D) and made
on or after March&nbsp;28, 2005, if the Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid
directly to an Eligible Retirement Plan the Participant specifies in a Direct Rollover or to
receive the distribution directly in accordance with Section&nbsp;6.01(A), then the Plan Administrator
will pay the distribution in a Direct Rollover to an Individual Retirement Plan the Plan
Administrator designates (&#147;Automatic Rollover&#148;). In the case of a Restated Plan with a restated
Effective Date before March&nbsp;29, 2005, as to any Mandatory Distribution which otherwise would be

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Direct Rollover. </B>A Direct Rollover is a payment by the Plan to the Eligible Retirement
Plan the distributee specifies in his/her Direct Rollover election or in the case of an Automatic
Rollover, to the Individual Retirement Plan that the Plan Administrator designates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Eligible Retirement Plan. </B>An Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account
described in Code &#167;408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code &#167;408(b), an annuity
plan described in Code &#167;403(a), a qualified trust described in Code &#167;401(a), an arrangement
described in Code &#167;403(b), or an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Code &#167;457(b)
sponsored by a governmental employer which accepts the Participant&#146;s or alternate payee&#146;s Eligible
Rollover Distribution. However, with regard to a Participant&#146;s Roth Deferral Account, an Eligible
Retirement Plan is a Roth IRA described in Code &#167;408A, a Roth account in another 401(k) plan which
permits Roth deferrals or a Roth account in a 403(b) plan which permits Roth deferrals.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;Eligible Rollover Distribution. </B>An Eligible Rollover Distribution is any distribution of
all or any portion of the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance, except: (a)&nbsp;any
distribution which is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Participant or the joint lives (or
joint life expectancies) of the Participant and the Participant&#146;s Designated Beneficiary, or for a
specified period of ten years or more; (b)&nbsp;any RMD under Section&nbsp;6.02; (c)&nbsp;the portion of any
distribution which is not includible in gross income (except for Roth Deferral Accounts, Employee
Contributions and determined without regard to the exclusion of net unrealized appreciation with
respect to employer securities); (d)&nbsp;any hardship distribution; (e)&nbsp;a corrective distribution made
under Article&nbsp;IV; (f)&nbsp;a deemed distribution resulting from a defaulted Participant loan which is
not also an offset distribution; (g)&nbsp;any other distributions described in Treas. Reg. &#167;1.402(c)-2;
and (h)&nbsp;as to a Direct Rollover, any distribution which otherwise would be an Eligible Rollover
Distribution, but where the total distributions to the Participant during that calendar year are
reasonably expected to be less than $200. For purposes of clause (h), a Participant&#146;s Roth
Deferral Account is deemed to constitute a separate plan that is subject to a separate $200 limit.
The Plan Administrator, in a form on which a Participant may elect a Direct Rollover, may restrict
a Participant from directly rolling over only a part of an Eligible Rollover Distribution where the
distribution amount does not exceed $500. In the case of such distribution exceeding $500, the Plan
Administrator&#146;s form may require that any amount the Participant elects to directly roll over be
equal to $500 or a lesser specified amount.

<U>REPLACEMENT OF $5,000 AMOUNT.</U> If the Employer in its Adoption Agreement under
Section&nbsp;6.01(A)(1) elects no Mandatory Distributions or elects a Mandatory Distribution amount
which is less than $5,000, all other Plan references to &#147;$5,000&#148; remain unchanged unless the
Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B elects to apply any lesser amount. However, any such override election does
not apply to Sections&nbsp;3.02(D) (relating to Catch-Up Deferrals, 3.10 (relating to SIMPLE Plans) and
3.12(C)(2) (relating to Designated IRAs) and references therein remain at $5,000. If this Plan is a
Restated Plan, any Employer election under this Section&nbsp;6.09 must be consistent with the Plan
Administrator&#146;s operation of the Plan prior to the Employer&#146;s execution of its Restated Plan.

the distribution designation had not been in effect or, if the Beneficiary revokes the distribution
designation, the amount which the Beneficiary would have received under Section&nbsp;6.02 if the

Segregated Account or a Participant-Directed Account. If any or all Plan investment Accounts are
Pooled Accounts, each Participant&#146;s Account has an undivided interest in the assets comprising the
Pooled Account. In a Pooled Account, the value of each Participant&#146;s Account Balance consists of
that proportion of the net worth (at fair market value) of the Trust Fund which the net credit
balance in his/her Account (exclusive of the cash value of incidental benefit insurance contracts)
bears to the total net credit balance in the Accounts (exclusive of the cash value of the

interest. As the Plan Administrator determines, a Participant-Directed Account may provide for a
limited number and type of investment options or funds, or may be open-ended and subject only to
any limitations imposed by ERISA or other Applicable Law. A Participant may have one or more
Participant-Directed Accounts in addition to Pooled or Segregated Accounts. A Participant-Directed
Account is credited and charged with the Earnings under Section&nbsp;7.04(B)(4)(e). As of each Valuation
Date, the Plan Administrator must reduce a Participant-Directed Account for any forfeiture arising
from Section&nbsp;5.07 after the Plan Administrator has made all other allocations, changes or

allocations; or (v)&nbsp;for such other purposes as the Plan Administrator may direct. A Segregated
Account receives all income it earns and bears all expense or loss it incurs. The Trustee will

Administrator or Trustee established the Account. As of each Valuation Date, the Plan Administrator
must reduce a Segregated Account for any forfeiture arising under Section&nbsp;5.07 after the Plan

Administrator must exercise its discretion under this Section&nbsp;7.04(C)(2) in a reasonable, uniform
and nondiscriminatory manner. The Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee to pay from the Trust
and to charge to the overall Plan or to particular Participant Accounts the expenses under this
Section&nbsp;7.04(C)(2) in accordance with the Plan Administrator&#146;s election of expense charging method
or policy.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(a)&nbsp;Charge to overall Plan (pro rata or per capita). </B>If the Plan Administrator charges a Plan
expense to the Accounts of all Participants, the Plan Administrator may allocate the Plan expense
either pro rata in relation to the total balance in each Account on the date the expense is
allocated (using the balance determined as of the most recent Valuation Date) or per capita (an
equal amount) to each Participant&#146;s Account.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;Charge to individual Participant Accounts. </B>The Plan Administrator, except as prohibited by
Applicable Law, may charge a Participant&#146;s Account for any reasonable Plan expenses directly
related to that Account, including, but not limited to the following categories of fees or
expenses: distribution, loan, acceptance of rollover, QDRO, &#147;lost Participant&#148; search, account
maintenance, brokerage accounts, investment management and benefit calculations. The Plan
Administrator may charge a Participant&#146;s Account for the reasonable expenses incurred in connection
with the maintenance of or a distribution from that Account even if the charging of such expenses
would result in the elimination of the Participant&#146;s Account or in the Participant&#146;s not receiving
an actual distribution. However, if the actual Account expenses exceed the Participant&#146;s Account
Balance, the Plan Administrator will not charge the Participant outside of the Plan for such excess
expenses.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(c)&nbsp;Participant&#146;s direct payment of investment expenses. </B>The Plan Administrator may permit
Participants to pay directly to the service provider, outside the Plan, Plan expenses such as
investment management fees, provided such expenses: (i)&nbsp;would be properly payable either by the
Employer or the Plan and are not &#147;settlor&#148; expenses payable exclusively by the Employer; (ii)&nbsp;are
not paid by the Employer or by the Plan; and (iii)&nbsp;are not intrinsic to the value of the Plan
assets as described in Rev. Rul. 86-142 or in any successor ruling. This Section&nbsp;7.04(C)(2)(c) does
not permit a Participant to reimburse the Plan for expenses the Plan previously has paid. To the
extent a Participant does not pay an expense the Participant may pay according to this Section
7.04(C)(2)(c), the Plan Administrator will charge the expense under Sections&nbsp;7.04(C)(2)(a) or
7.04(C)(2)(b) in accordance with the Plan Administrator&#146;s expense policy.

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Beneficiary Designation. </B>A Participant from time to time may designate, in writing, any
person(s) (including a trust or other entity), contingently or successively, to whom the Trustee
will pay all or any portion of the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance (including any life
insurance proceeds payable to the Participant&#146;s Account) in the event of death. A Participant under
Section&nbsp;6.03(B)(1) also may designate the method of distribution of his/her Account to the
Beneficiary. The Plan Administrator will prescribe the form for the Participant&#146;s written
designation of Beneficiary and, upon the Participant&#146;s proper completion and filing of the form
with the Plan Administrator, the form effectively revokes all designations filed prior to that date
by the same Participant. This Section&nbsp;7.05(A) also applies to the interest of a deceased
Beneficiary or a deceased alternate payee where
the Beneficiary or alternate payee has designated a Beneficiary.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Automatic revocation of spousal designation. </B>A divorce decree, or a decree of legal
separation, revokes the Participant&#146;s prior designation, if any, of his/her spouse or former spouse
as his/her Beneficiary under the Plan unless: (a)&nbsp;a QDRO provides otherwise; or (b)&nbsp;the Employer in
Appendix&nbsp;B elects otherwise. This Section&nbsp;7.05(A)(1) applies solely to a Participant whose divorce
or legal separation becomes effective on or after the date the Employer executes this Plan unless:
(i)&nbsp;the Plan is a Restated Plan and the prior Plan contained a provision to the same effect; or
(ii)&nbsp;regardless of the application of (i), the Employer in Appendix&nbsp;A provides for a special
Effective Date for this Section&nbsp;7.05(A)(1).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Coordination with QJSA/QPSA requirements. </B>If Section&nbsp;6.04 applies to the Participant, this
Section&nbsp;7.05 does not impose any special spousal consent requirements on the Participant&#146;s
Beneficiary designation unless the Participant waives the QJSA or QPSA benefit. If the Participant
waives the QJSA or QPSA benefit without spousal consent to the Participant&#146;s Beneficiary
designation: (a)&nbsp;any waiver of the QJSA or of the QPSA is not valid; and (b)&nbsp;if the Participant
dies prior to his/her Annuity Starting Date, the Participant&#146;s Beneficiary designation will apply
only to the portion of the death benefit which is not payable as a QPSA. Regarding clause (b), if
the Participant&#146;s surviving spouse is a primary Beneficiary under the Participant&#146;s Beneficiary
designation, the Trustee will satisfy the spouse&#146;s interest in the Participant&#146;s death benefit
first from the portion which is payable as a QPSA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;Profit Sharing Plan exception. </B>If the Plan is a Profit Sharing Plan which the Employer
under Section&nbsp;6.04(G) has elected in its Adoption Agreement to exempt all Exempt Participants from
the QJSA and QPSA requirements of Section&nbsp;6.04, the Beneficiary designation of a married Exempt
Participant, as described in Section&nbsp;6.04(G), is not valid unless the Participant&#146;s spouse consents
(in a manner described in Section&nbsp;6.04(A)(7)) to the Beneficiary designation. The spousal consent
requirement in this Section&nbsp;7.05(A)(3) does not apply if the Participant&#146;s spouse is the
Participant&#146;s sole primary Beneficiary. The Employer in its Adoption Agreement will elect whether
to apply the &#147;one-year marriage rule.&#148; If the Employer elects to apply the one-year marriage rule,
the spousal consent requirement of this Section&nbsp;7.05(A)(3) does not apply unless the Exempt
Participant and his/her spouse were married throughout the one year period ending on the date of
the Participant&#146;s death. If the Employer elects to apply the one-year marriage rule under this
Section&nbsp;7.05(A)(3), but the Participant is not an Exempt Participant (such that the QJSA and QPSA
requirements apply to the Participant), the one-year marriage rule under Section&nbsp;6.04(B) applies to
the QPSA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(4)&nbsp;Limitation on frequency of Designated Beneficiary changes. </B>A Participant may change
his/her Designated Beneficiary in accordance with this Section&nbsp;7.05(A) as often as the Participant
wishes, unless the Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B elects to impose a minimum time interval between changes,
but with an exception for certain major life events, such as death of a Beneficiary, divorce and
other such events as the Plan Administrator reasonably may determine.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(5)&nbsp;Definition of spouse. </B>The Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B may define the term &#147;spouse&#148; for all
Plan purposes provided such definition is consistent with Applicable Law. In the absence of such
an Appendix&nbsp;B definition, the Plan Administrator will interpret and apply the term &#148;spouse&#148; in a
manner which is consistent with Applicable Law.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Default Beneficiary. </B>If: (i)&nbsp;a Participant fails to name a Beneficiary in accordance with

Participant designates predecease the Participant, are invalid for any reason, or disclaim the
Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance and the Plan Administrator has accepted the disclaimers as
valid under Applicable Law, then the Trustee (subject to any contrary provision in Appendix&nbsp;B

if the Plan is a Profit Sharing Plan, and the Plan includes Exempt Participants, as to such Exempt
Participants, the Employer may not specify a different default Beneficiary list or order unless the

distribution of the Participant&#146;s entire Vested Account Balance, the Trustee will distribute the
remaining Vested Account Balance in the same manner as described in Section&nbsp;7.05(B) and (C)
(applied as though the Beneficiary were the Participant) unless: (1)&nbsp;the Participant&#146;s Beneficiary
designation provides otherwise; or (2)&nbsp;the Beneficiary has properly designated a beneficiary. A
Beneficiary only may designate a beneficiary for the Participant&#146;s Account Balance remaining at the
Beneficiary&#146;s death if the Participant has not previously designated a successive contingent
beneficiary and the Beneficiary&#146;s designation otherwise complies with the Plan terms.

should die simultaneously, or under circumstances that render it difficult or impossible to
determine who predeceased the other, then unless the Participant&#146;s Beneficiary designation
otherwise specifies, the Plan Administrator will presume conclusively that the Beneficiary
predeceased the Participant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(F)&nbsp;Incapacitated Participant or Beneficiary. </B>If, in the opinion of the Plan Administrator, a
Participant or Beneficiary entitled to a Plan distribution is not able to care for his/her affairs
because of a mental condition, a physical condition, or by reason of age, at the direction of the
Plan Administrator, the Trustee will make the distribution to the Participant&#146;s or Beneficiary&#146;s
guardian, conservator, trustee,
custodian (including under a Uniform Transfers or Gifts to Minors Act) or to his/her
attorney-in-fact or to other legal representative, upon furnishing evidence of such status
satisfactory to the Plan Administrator and to the Trustee. The Plan Administrator and the Trustee
do not have any liability with respect to payments so made and neither the Plan Administrator nor
the Trustee has any duty to make inquiry as to the competence of any person entitled to receive
payments under the Plan.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(G)&nbsp;Assignment or Alienation. </B>Except as provided in Code &#167;414(p) relating to QDROs (or a domestic
relations order entered into before January&nbsp;1, 1985) and in Code &#167;401(a)(13) relating to certain
voluntary, revocable assignments, judgments and settlements, neither a Participant nor a
Beneficiary may anticipate, assign or alienate (either at law or in equity) any benefit provided
under the Plan, and the Trustee will not recognize any such anticipation, assignment or alienation.
Except as provided by Code &#167;401(a)(13) or other Applicable Law, a benefit under the Plan is not
subject to attachment, garnishment, levy, execution or other legal or equitable process.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(H)&nbsp;Information Available. </B>Any Participant or Beneficiary without charge may examine the Plan
description, copy of the latest annual report, any bargaining agreement, this Plan and Trust, and
any contract or any other instrument which relates to the establishment or administration of the
Plan or Trust. The Plan Administrator will maintain all of the items listed in this Section&nbsp;7.05(H)
in its office, or in such other place or places as it may designate from time to time in order to
comply with ERISA, for examination during reasonable business hours. Upon the written request of a
Participant or a Beneficiary, the Plan Administrator must furnish the Participant or Beneficiary
with a copy of any item listed in this Section&nbsp;7.05(H). The Plan Administrator may impose a
reasonable copying charge upon the requesting person.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(I)&nbsp;Claims Procedure for Denial of Benefits. </B>A Participant or a Beneficiary may file with the Plan
Administrator a written claim for benefits, if the Participant or the Beneficiary disputes the Plan
Administrator&#146;s determination regarding the Participant&#146;s or Beneficiary&#146;s Plan benefit. However,
the Plan will distribute only such Plan benefits to Participants or Beneficiaries as the Plan
Administrator in its discretion determines a Participant or Beneficiary is entitled to receive. The
Plan Administrator will maintain a separate written document as part of (or which accompanies) the
Plan&#146;s summary plan description explaining the Plan&#146;s claims procedure. This Section&nbsp;7.05(I)
specifically incorporates the written claims procedure as from time to time published by the Plan
Administrator as a part of the Plan. If the Plan Administrator pursuant to the Plan&#146;s written
claims procedure makes a final written determination denying a Participant&#146;s or Beneficiary&#146;s
benefit claim, the Participant or Beneficiary to preserve the claim must file an action with
respect to the denied claim not later than 180&nbsp;days following the date of the Plan Administrator&#146;s
final determination.

determine the identity of a Participant&#146;s Beneficiary under circumstances of competing claims or
otherwise, the Plan Administrator may file an interpleader action seeking an order of the court as
to the determination of the Beneficiary. The Plan Administrator, the Trustee and other Plan
fiduciaries may act in reliance upon any proper order issued under this Section&nbsp;7.05(J) in
maintaining, distributing or otherwise disposing of a Participant&#146;s Account under the Plan terms,
to any Beneficiary specified in the court&#146;s order.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Requirements for Plan Loans. </B>The Trustee, as directed by the Plan Administrator will make a
Plan loan to a Participant or to a Beneficiary in accordance with the loan policy, under Section
7.06(A), provided: (1)&nbsp;loans are available to all Participants and Beneficiaries on a reasonably
equivalent basis and are not available in a greater amount for HCEs than for NHCEs; (2)&nbsp;any loan is
adequately secured and bears a reasonable rate of interest; (3)&nbsp;the loan provides for repayment
within a specified time (except that the loan policy may suspend loan payments pursuant to Code

permit offset of the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance only at the time when the Participant has
a distributable event under the Plan, but without regard to whether the Participant consents to
distribution as otherwise may be required under Section&nbsp;6.01(A)(2); (5)&nbsp;the amount of the loan does
not exceed (at the time the Plan extends the loan) the present value of the Participant&#146;s Vested
Account Balance; and (6)&nbsp;the loan otherwise conforms to the exemption provided by Code &#167;4975(d)(1).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Default as Distributable Event. </B>The loan policy may provide a Participant&#146;s loan default is a
distributable event with respect to the defaulted amount, irrespective of whether the Participant
otherwise has incurred a distributable event at the time of default, except as to Restricted 401(k)
Accounts or Restricted Pension Accounts under Section&nbsp;6.01(C)(4) which the Participant used to
secure his/her loan and which are not then distributable at the time of default. See Section&nbsp;6.06.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(D)&nbsp;QJSA/QPSA Requirements</B>. If the QJSA/QPSA requirements of Section&nbsp;6.04 apply to the Participant,
the Participant may not pledge any portion of his/her Account Balance that is subject to such
requirements as security for a loan unless, within the 90&nbsp;day period ending on the date the pledge
becomes effective, the Participant&#146;s spouse, if any, consents (in a manner described in Section
6.04 other than the requirement relating to the consent of a subsequent spouse) to the security or,
by separate consent, to an increase in the amount of security. See Section&nbsp;6.04(D) regarding the
affect of an outstanding loan pledge on the QJSA or QPSA benefit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(E)&nbsp;Treatment of Loan as Participant-Directed. </B>The Plan Administrator, to the extent provided in a
written loan policy
and consistent with Section&nbsp;7.03(B)(3), will treat a Plan loan made to a Participant as a
Participant-directed investment, even if the Plan otherwise does not permit a Participant to direct
his/her Account investments. Where a loan is treated as a directed investment, the borrowing
Participant&#146;s Account alone shares in any interest paid on the loan, and the Account alone bears
any expense or loss it incurs in connection with the loan. The Trustee may retain any principal or
interest paid on the borrowing Participant&#146;s loan in a Segregated Account (as described in Section
7.04(A)(2)(c)) on behalf of the borrowing Participant until the Trustee (or the Named Fiduciary, in
the case of a nondiscretionary Trustee) deems it appropriate to add the loan payments to the
Participant&#146;s Account under the Plan.

or Beneficiary whose Account becomes distributable under the Plan or if the Plan has made a
distribution, but the Participant for any reason does not cash the distribution check (a &#147;lost
Participant&#148;), the Plan Administrator will apply the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.07. The
provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.07 no longer apply if the Plan Administrator, prior to taking action
to dispose of the lost Participant&#146;s Account under Section&nbsp;7.07(A)(2) or 7.07(B)(2), is able to
complete the distribution.

using any of the search methods described in Section&nbsp;7.07(C), the Plan Administrator may forfeit
the lost Participant&#146;s Account, provided the Account is not subject to the Automatic Rollover rules
of Section&nbsp;6.08(D), unless forfeiture is contrary to Applicable Law. If the Plan Administrator
forfeits the lost Participant&#146;s Account, the forfeiture occurs at the end of the above-described
6-month period and the Plan Administrator will allocate the forfeiture in accordance with Section
3.07. The Plan Administrator under this Section&nbsp;7.07(A)(2) will forfeit the entire Account of the
lost Participant, including Elective Deferrals and Employee Contributions.

thereafter at any time but before the Plan has been terminated makes a claim for his/her forfeited
Account, the Plan Administrator will restore the forfeited Account to the same dollar amount as the
amount forfeited, unadjusted for Earnings occurring subsequent to the forfeiture. The Plan
Administrator will make the restoration in the Plan Year in which the lost Participant makes the
claim, first from the amount, if any, of Participant forfeitures the Plan Administrator otherwise
would allocate for the Plan Year, and then from the amount or additional amount the Employer
contributes to the Plan for the Plan Year. The Employer in Appendix&nbsp;B may provide that the Plan
Administrator will use Trust Fund Earnings for the Plan Year, if any, as a source of the
restoration, or may modify the order of priority of the sources of restoration described in the
previous sentence. The Plan Administrator will distribute the restored Account to the lost
Participant not later than 60&nbsp;days after the close of the Plan Year in which the Plan Administrator
restores the forfeited Account.

provide for an Annuity Contract as a method of distribution and the Employer does not maintain
another Defined Contribution Plan, the Plan Administrator will distribute the lost Participant&#146;s
Account in an Automatic Rollover to an individual retirement plan under Section&nbsp;6.08(D), unless the
Plan Administrator determines it is impractical to complete an Automatic Rollover or is unable to
locate an individual retirement plan provider willing to accept the rollover distribution. In such
event, the Plan Administrator may: (i)&nbsp;distribute the Participant&#146;s Account to an interest-bearing
insured bank account the Plan Administrator establishes in the Participant&#146;s name; or (ii)
distribute the Participant&#146;s Account to the unclaimed property fund of the state of the

Contribution Plan.

distribution notice to the lost Participant at the Participant&#146;s last known address by certified or
registered mail; (2)&nbsp;check with other employee benefit plans of the Employer that may have more
up-to-date information regarding the Participant&#146;s whereabouts; (3)&nbsp;identify and contact the
Participant&#146;s designated Beneficiary under Section&nbsp;7.05; (4)&nbsp;use the IRS letter forwarding program
under Rev. Proc. 94-22 or the Social Security Administration search program; and (5)&nbsp;use a
commercial locator service, credit reporting agencies, the internet or other search method.
Regarding search methods (2)&nbsp;and (3)&nbsp;above, if the Plan Administrator encounters privacy concerns,
the Plan Administrator may request that the Employer or other plan fiduciary (under (2)), or the
designated Beneficiary (under (3)), contact the Participant or forward a letter requesting that the
Participant contact the Plan Administrator.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(D)&nbsp;Uniformity. </B>The Plan Administrator will apply Section&nbsp;7.07 in a reasonable, uniform and
nondiscriminatory manner,
but in determining a specific course of action as to a particular Account, reasonably may take into
account differing circumstances such as the amount of a lost Participant&#146;s Account, the expense in
attempting to locate a lost Participant, the Plan Administrator&#146;s ability to establish and the
expense of establishing a rollover IRA, and other factors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(E)&nbsp;Expenses of search. </B>The Plan Administrator, in accordance with Section&nbsp;7.04(C)(2)(b), may
charge to the Account of a Participant the reasonable expenses incurred under this Section&nbsp;7.07 and
which are associated with the Participant&#146;s Account, without regard to whether or when the Plan
Administrator actually locates or makes a distribution to the Participant.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(F)&nbsp;Alternative Disposition. </B>The Plan Administrator under Sections&nbsp;7.07(A) or (B)&nbsp;operationally may
dispose of a lost Participant&#146;s Account in any reasonable manner which is not inconsistent with
Applicable Law. The Plan Administrator may adopt a policy under this Section&nbsp;7.07 as it deems
reasonable or appropriate to administer the Accounts of lost Participants, provided that: (1)&nbsp;the
terms of any such policy must be uniform and nondiscriminatory; (2)&nbsp;the Plan Administrator must
administer the policy in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner; and (3)&nbsp;the policy must not be
inconsistent with Applicable Law. The Plan Administrator also may administer lost Participant
Accounts consistent with Applicable Law which is contrary to any provision of Section&nbsp;7.07, unless
such Applicable Law requires a Plan amendment, in which case the Employer within any required
deadline will amend the Plan to comply.

deems necessary, including correction to preserve tax qualification of the Plan under Code &#167;401(a),
to correct a fiduciary breach under ERISA or to unwind (correct)&nbsp;a prohibited transaction under the
Code or ERISA. Without limiting the Plan Administrator&#146;s authority under the prior sentence, the
Plan Administrator, as it determines to be reasonable and appropriate, may undertake or assist the
Employer in undertaking correction of Plan document, operational, demographic and employer
eligibility failures under a method described in the Plan or under the Employee Plans Compliance
Resolution System (&#147;EPCRS&#148;) or any successor program to EPCRS. The Plan Administrator, as it
determines to be reasonable and appropriate, also may undertake or assist the Employer, the Trustee
of other appropriate Plan fiduciary or Plan official in undertaking correction of a fiduciary
breach, including correction under the Voluntary Fiduciary Correction Program (&#147;VFCP&#148;) or any
successor program to VFCP. If the Plan is a 401(k) Plan, the Plan Administrator to correct an
operational failure other than a failure of Code &#167;415 or Code &#167;402(g) limitations or a failure of
the ADP or ACP tests (or to correct such listed failures beyond the time permitted under
regulations), may require the Trustee to distribute from the Plan Elective Deferrals, including
Earnings thereon, and the Plan Administrator will treat any Matching Contributions and Earnings
thereon relating to the distributed Elective Deferrals, as an Associated Matching Contribution
under Section&nbsp;3.07(A)(1).

reasonable judgment of the Trustee, some or all Plan assets, within a reasonable time for making

</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Appointment. </B>The Employer, in writing, may appoint any qualified person in any state to act as
ancillary trustee with respect to a designated portion of the Trust Fund, subject to any consent
required under Section&nbsp;1.65. An ancillary trustee must acknowledge in a writing separate from the

ancillary trustee and its fiduciary status under ERISA.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Powers</B>. The ancillary trustee has the rights, powers, duties and discretion as the Employer may
delegate, subject to any limitations or directions specified in the agreement appointing the
ancillary trustee and to the terms of the Plan or of ERISA. The Employer may delegate its
responsibilities under this Section&nbsp;8.07 to a discretionary Trustee under the Plan (subject to the
acceptance by such discretionary Trustee of that delegation), but the Employer may not delegate its
responsibilities to a nondiscretionary Trustee or to a Custodian. The investment powers delegated
to the ancillary trustee may include any investment powers available under Section&nbsp;8.02. The
delegated investment powers may include the right to invest any portion of the assets of the Trust
Fund in a common trust fund, as described in Code &#167;584, or in any collective investment fund, the
provisions of which govern the investment of such assets and which the Plan incorporates by this
reference, but only if the ancillary trustee is a bank or similar financial institution supervised
by the United States or by a state and the ancillary trustee (or its affiliate, as defined in Code
&#167;1504) maintains the common trust fund or collective investment fund exclusively for the collective
investment of money contributed by the ancillary trustee (or its affiliate) in a trustee capacity
and which conforms to the rules of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Employer also may appoint
as an ancillary trustee, the trustee of any group trust fund designated for investment pursuant to
the provisions of Section&nbsp;8.09.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Resignation/Removal. </B>The ancillary trustee may resign its position and the Employer may remove
an ancillary trustee as provided in Section&nbsp;8.08 regarding resignation and removal of the Trustee
or Custodian. In the event of such resignation or removal, the Employer may appoint another
ancillary trustee or may return the assets to the control and management of the Trustee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(D)&nbsp;Independent Fiduciary. </B>If the DOL requires engagement of an independent fiduciary to have
control or management of all or a portion of the Trust Fund, the Employer will appoint such
independent fiduciary, as directed by the DOL. The independent fiduciary will have the duties,
responsibilities and powers prescribed by the DOL and will exercise those duties, responsibilities
and powers in accordance with the terms, restrictions and conditions established by the DOL and, to
the extent not inconsistent with ERISA, the terms of the Plan. The independent fiduciary must
accept its appointment in writing and must acknowledge its status as a fiduciary of the Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.08 <U>RESIGNATION AND REMOVAL</U>.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Resignation</B>. The Trustee or the Custodian may resign its position by giving written notice to
the Employer and to the Plan Administrator. The Trustee&#146;s notice must specify the effective date of
the Trustee&#146;s resignation, which date must be at least 30&nbsp;days following the date of the Trustee&#146;s
notice, unless the Employer consents in writing to shorter notice.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Removal. </B>The Employer may remove a Trustee or a Custodian by giving written notice to the
affected party. The Employer&#146;s notice must specify the effective date of removal which date must be
at least 30&nbsp;days following the date of the Employer&#146;s notice, except where the Employer reasonably
determines a shorter notice period or immediate removal is necessary to protect Plan assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Successor Appointment. </B>In the event of the resignation or the removal of a Trustee, where no
other Trustee continues to serve, the Employer must appoint a successor Trustee if it intends to
continue the Plan. If two or more persons hold the position of Trustee, in the event of the removal
of one such person, during any period the selection of a replacement is pending, or during any
period such person is unable to serve for any reason, the remaining person or persons will act as
the Trustee.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Default Successor Trustee</B>. If the Employer fails to appoint a successor Trustee as of the
effective date of the Trustee resignation or removal and no other Trustee remains, the Trustee will
treat the Employer as having appointed itself as Trustee and as having filed the Employer&#146;s
acceptance of appointment as successor Trustee with the former Trustee. If state law prohibits the
Employer from serving as successor Trustee, the appointed successor Trustee is the president of a
corporate Employer, the managing partner of a partnership Employer, the managing member of a
limited liability company Employer, the sole proprietor of a proprietorship Employer, or in the
case of any other entity type, such other person with title and responsibilities similar to the
foregoing.

Trustee will assume possession of Plan assets held by the former Custodian.

appointment as successor Trustee and by filing the acceptance with the former Trustee and the Plan

authorizes the Trustee to invest all or any portion of the assets comprising the Trust Fund in any
group trust fund which at the time of the investment provides for the pooling of the assets of
plans qualified under Code &#167;401(a), including a group trust fund that also permits the pooling of
qualified plan assets with assets of an individual retirement account that is exempt from taxation
under Code &#167;408(e) or assets of an eligible governmental plan under Code &#167;457(b) that is exempt
from taxation under Code &#167;457(g). This authorization applies solely to a group trust fund exempt
from taxation under Code &#167;501(a) and the trust agreement of which satisfies the requirements of
Revenue Ruling 81-100 (as modified and clarified by Revenue Ruling 2004-67), or any successor
thereto. The provisions of the group trust fund agreement, as amended from time to time, are by
this reference incorporated within this Plan and Trust. The provisions of the group trust fund will
govern any investment of Plan assets in that fund. To comply with Code &#167;4975(d)(8) as to any group
trust fund maintained by a disqualified person, including the Trustee, the following provisions
apply: (A)&nbsp;a discretionary Trustee or a nondiscretionary Trustee may invest in any such fund at the
direction of the Named Fiduciary who is independent of the Trustee and the Trustee&#146;s affiliates;
(B)&nbsp;a discretionary Trustee or a nondiscretionary Trustee (the latter as directed) may invest in
any such fund which the Employer specifies in Appendix&nbsp;C; and (C)&nbsp;notwithstanding (A)&nbsp;and (B)&nbsp;a
discretionary Trustee may invest in its own funds as described in Section&nbsp;8.02(A)(3).

Allocation is 5%, irrespective of the Highest Contribution Rate, and the Plan Administrator will
allocate the contribution in accordance with Section&nbsp;10.02(B). If the Plan Administrator elects for
the Employer to satisfy the top-heavy minimum benefit in a Defined Benefit Plan, the Plan
Administrator must determine that such top-heavy minimum benefit is sufficient to satisfy the
top-heavy requirements in the Plan.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.04 <U>TOP-HEAVY VESTING</U>. If the Employer in its Adoption Agreement does not elect
immediate vesting, the Employer must elect a top-heavy (or modified top-heavy) vesting schedule.
The specified top-heavy vesting schedule applies to all Accounts and Contribution Types not already
subject to greater vesting and applies to the Plan&#146;s first top-heavy Plan Year and to all
subsequent Plan Years, except as the Employer in its Adoption Agreement otherwise elects. If the
Employer elects in its Adoption Agreement to apply the specified top-heavy vesting schedule only in
Plan Years in which the Plan is top-heavy, any change in the Plan&#146;s vesting schedule resulting from
this election is subject to Section&nbsp;5.08, relating to vesting schedule amendments. As such, a
Participant&#146;s vested percentage may not decrease as a result of a change in the Plan&#146;s top-heavy
status in a subsequent Plan Year. When applicable, the relevant top-heavy vesting schedule applies
to a Participant&#146;s entire Account Balance except as to those amounts which are already 100% Vested,
and applies to such amounts accrued before the Plan became top-heavy.

there are no forfeitures to allocate for the Plan Year or the Plan Administrator allocates
forfeitures in the manner Section&nbsp;3.07(A)(4) describes, the Plan will not be subject to the
top-heavy requirements of this Article&nbsp;X for that Plan Year. In accordance with Section&nbsp;3.07(A)(4),
the Employer in its Adoption Agreement may elect to apply forfeitures in such a manner so as to
preserve the top-heavy exemption under this Section&nbsp;10.05(A). This Section&nbsp;10.05(A) does not apply
if the Employer in its Adoption Agreement elects eligibility for Elective Deferrals which is
earlier than the one Year of Service and age 21 eligibility requirements the Employer elects to

first Plan Year.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Determination (look-back) Period</B>. Determination Period means the 1-year period ending on the
Determination Date. In the case of distributions made for a reason other than Severance from
Employment, death or Disability, the determination period means the 5-year period ending on the
Determination Date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(D)&nbsp;Employer. </B>Employer means the Employer that adopts this Plan and any Related Employer.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(E)&nbsp;Highest Contribution Rate. </B>Highest Contribution Rate means for any Key Employee, all Employer
Contributions (including Elective Deferrals, but not including Employer contributions to Social
Security and not including Catch-Up Deferrals) and forfeitures allocated to the Participant&#146;s
Account for the Plan Year, divided by his/her Compensation for the entire Plan Year. To determine a
Key Employee&#146;s contribution rate, the Plan Administrator must treat all qualified top-heavy Defined
Contribution Plans maintained by the Employer (or by any Related Employer) as a single plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(F)&nbsp;Key Employee. </B>Key Employee means, as of any Determination Date, any Employee or former Employee

plus any other qualified plans maintained by the Employer, but only if such group would satisfy in
the aggregate the nondiscrimination requirements of Code &#167;401(a)(4) and the coverage requirements
of Code &#167;410. The Plan Administrator will determine the Permissive Aggregation Group.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(J)&nbsp;Required Aggregation Group. </B>Required Aggregation Group means: (1)&nbsp;each qualified plan of the
Employer in which at least one Key Employee participates or participated at any time during the
Determination Period (including terminated plans); and (2)&nbsp;any other qualified plan of the Employer
which enables a plan described in clause (1)&nbsp;to meet the requirements of Code &#167;401(a)(4) or of Code

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(K)&nbsp;Top-Heavy Ratio</B>. Top-Heavy Ratio means a fraction, the numerator of which is the sum of the
Account Balances of all Key Employees as of the Determination Date and the denominator of which is
the sum of the Account Balances for all Employees as of the Determination Date. The Plan
Administrator will include Catch-Up Deferrals and will disregard DECs in determining the Top-Heavy
Ratio.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Amounts included. </B>The Plan Administrator must include in the Top-Heavy Ratio, as part of
the Account Balances, any contribution not made as of the Determination Date but includible under
Code &#167;416 and the applicable Treasury regulations, and distributions made within the Determination
Period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;Former Key Employees. </B>The Plan Administrator must calculate the Top-Heavy Ratio by
disregarding the Account Balance (and distributions, if any, of the Account Balance) of any Non-Key
Employee who was formerly a Key Employee.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(3)&nbsp;No Service during 1-year look-back</B>. The Plan Administrator must calculate the Top-Heavy

of an individual who has not received credit for at least one Hour of Service with the Employer
during the Determination Period, which for purposes of this Section&nbsp;10.06(K)(3), means the 1-year
period described in Section&nbsp;10.06(C).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(4)&nbsp;Distributions, Rollover Contributions and Transfers. </B>The Plan Administrator must calculate
the Top-Heavy Ratio, including the extent to which it must take into account distributions,
Rollover Contributions and Transfers, in accordance with Code &#167;416 and the applicable Treasury
regulations.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(L)&nbsp;Top-Heavy Minimum Allocation. </B>Top-Heavy Minimum Allocation means an allocation equal to the
lesser of 3% of the Non-Key Employee&#146;s Compensation for the Plan Year or the highest contribution
rate for the Plan Year made on behalf of any Key Employee multiplied by the Non-Key Employee&#146;s Plan
Year Compensation. For purposes of satisfying the Employer&#146;s Top-Heavy Minimum Allocation
requirement, the Plan Administrator disregards the Elective Deferrals allocated to a Non-Key
Employee&#146;s Account in determining the Non-Key Employee&#146;s allocation rate. To determine a Non-Key
Employee&#146;s allocation rate, the Plan Administrator must treat all qualified top-heavy Defined
Contribution Plans maintained by the Employer (or by any Related Employer) as a single plan. If a
Defined Benefit Plan maintained by the Employer which benefits a Key Employee depends on this Plan
to satisfy the nondiscrimination rules of Code &#167;401(a)(4) or the coverage rules of Code &#167;410 (or
another plan benefiting the Key Employee so depends on such Defined Benefit Plan), the top-heavy
minimum allocation is 3% of the Non-Key Employee&#146;s Compensation regardless of the contribution rate
for the Key Employees.

the Plan Administrator will direct the Trustee to distribute in cash (subject to Section&nbsp;8.04) the
Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance to him/her in a Lump-Sum as soon as administratively
practicable after the Plan terminates.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(2)&nbsp;If consent required</B>. If the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance exceeds $5,000 and the

Beneficiary may elect to have the Trustee commence distribution in cash (subject to Section&nbsp;8.04)
of his/her Vested Account Balance in a Lump-Sum as soon as administratively practicable after the
Plan terminates. If a Participant with consent rights under this Section&nbsp;11.05(D)(2) does not elect
an immediate Lump-Sum distribution with spousal consent if required, to liquidate the Trust, the
Plan Administrator will instruct the Trustee or Custodian to purchase a deferred Annuity Contract
for the Participant which protects the Participant&#146;s distribution rights under the Plan.

distribute in cash (subject to Section&nbsp;8.04) each Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance, in a
Lump-Sum, as soon as administratively practicable after the termination of the Plan, irrespective
of the amount of the Participant&#146;s Vested Account Balance, the Participant&#146;s age and whether the
Participant consents to the distribution.

same meaning as the Signatory Employer for purposes of making Plan amendments and other purposes as
described in Section&nbsp;1.23(A) regardless of whether the Lead Employer is also a Participating
Employer under this Article&nbsp;XII. As to the right of a Lead Employer to terminate the participation

elections; (B)&nbsp;which elections the Participating Employer may modify; and (C)&nbsp;any restrictions on
the modifications. Any such modification will apply only to the Employees of that Participating
Employer. The Participating Employer will make any such modification by election on its
Participation Agreement to the Lead Employer&#146;s Adoption Agreement. To the extent that the Adoption
Agreement does not permit modification of an election, any attempt by a Participating Employer to

B, the Lead Employer may terminate the participation of any Participating Employer (hereafter,
&#147;Terminated Employer&#148;) in this Plan. If the Lead Employer acts under this Section&nbsp;12.12, the
following will occur:
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(A)&nbsp;Notice. </B>The Lead Employer will give the Terminated Employer a notice of the Lead Employer&#146;s
intent to terminate the Terminated Employer&#146;s status as a Participating Employer of the Plan. The
Lead Employer will provide such notice not less than 30&nbsp;days prior to the Effective Date of
termination unless the Lead Employer determines that the interests of Plan Participants requires
earlier termination.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(B)&nbsp;Spin-off. </B>The Lead Employer will establish a new Defined Contribution Plan, using the
provisions of this Plan with any modifications contained in the Terminated Employer&#146;s Participation
Agreement, as a guide to establish a new Defined Contribution Plan (the &#147;Spin-off Plan&#148;). The Lead
Employer will direct the Trustee to transfer (in accordance with the rules of Code &#167;414(l) and the
provisions of Section&nbsp;11.06) the Accounts of the Employees of the Terminated Employer to the
Spin-off Plan. The Terminated Employer will be the Employer, Plan Administrator, and Sponsor of the
Spin-off Plan. The Trustee of the Spin-off Plan will be the person or entity designated by the
Terminated Employer, or, in the absence of any such designation, the Terminated Employer itself. If
state law prohibits the Terminated Employer from serving as Trustee, the Trustee is the president
of a corporate Terminated Employer, the managing partner of a partnership Terminated Employer, the
managing member of a limited liability company Terminated Employer, the sole proprietor of a
proprietorship Terminated Employer, or in the case of any other entity type, such other person with
title and responsibilities similar to the foregoing. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the
Lead Employer may designate a financial institution as Trustee if the Lead Employer, in its sole
discretion, deems it necessary to protect the interests of the Participants. The Lead Employer may
charge the Terminated Employer or the Accounts of the Employees of the Terminated Employer with the
reasonable expenses of establishing the Spin-off Plan.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>(C)&nbsp;Alternatives. </B>The Terminated Employer, in lieu of the Lead Employer&#146;s creation of the Spin-off
Plan under Section&nbsp;12.12(B), may elect one of the two other alternatives under Sections&nbsp;12.12(C)(1)
or (2)&nbsp;to effect the termination of its status as a Participating Employer. To elect an
alternative, the Terminated Employer must give notice to the Lead Employer of its choice, and must
supply any documentation which the Lead Employer reasonably may require as soon as is practical and
before the Effective Date of termination. If the Lead Employer has not received such notice and any
required documentation within 5&nbsp;days prior to the Effective Date of termination, the Lead Employer
may proceed with the Spin-off Plan under Section&nbsp;12.12(B).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(1)&nbsp;Distribution. </B>The Lead Employer will direct the Trustee to distribute the Account Balances
of the Employees of the Terminated Employer as soon as practical after termination. However, if
such an Employee also is employed by another Participating Employer, the Trustee will not
distribute, but will continue to hold that Employee&#146;s Account Balance pursuant to the terms of the
Plan. All Account Balances distributed under this Section&nbsp;12.12(C)(1) will be 100% Vested. However,
no such distribution may violate the restrictions of Sections&nbsp;6.01(C)(4)(b) and (c). If this Plan
includes Restricted 401(k) Accounts under Section&nbsp;6.01(C)(4)(b), the termination of the
Participating Employer&#146;s sponsorship of this Plan will be deemed to be a termination of the Plan
and the Plan Year as to the Employees receiving distributions under this Section
