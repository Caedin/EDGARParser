<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 1. <U>Purpose of the Plan</U>.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Amended and Restated Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;) amends
and restates the Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc. 2006 Incentive Plan (the &#147;Prior Plan&#148;) and is intended
to promote the interests of Allis-Chalmers Energy Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and
its stockholders by encouraging officers, employees, non-employee directors and consultants of the
Company and its Affiliates to acquire or increase their equity interests in the Company and to
provide a means whereby they may develop a sense of proprietorship and personal involvement in the
development and financial success of the Company, and to encourage them to remain with and devote
their best efforts to the business of the Company thereby advancing the interests of the Company
and its stockholders. The Board of Directors of the Company also contemplates that through the
Plan, the Company and its Affiliates will be better able to attract and retain the services of
individuals who are essential for the growth and profitability of the Company. The Plan provides
for payment of various forms of incentive compensation and accordingly is not intended to be a plan
that is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, and shall be
administered accordingly.
