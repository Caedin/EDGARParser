as ordinary income at that time. Participant may elect to be taxed at the effective time of
this award when the shares are acquired rather than when such shares vest and cease to be
subject to such forfeiture restrictions by filing an election under Section 83(b) of the

such an election is made, Participant will have to make a tax payment to the extent the
purchase price, if any, is less than the fair market value of the shares on the date hereof.
No tax payment will have to be made to the extent the purchase price, if any, is at least
equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date hereof. Failure to make this
filing within the thirty (30)&nbsp;day period will result in the recognition of ordinary income
