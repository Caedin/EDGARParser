be so employed or terminates a period of Related Employment by reason of the Participant&#146;s disability or retirement (as such terms are defined in the Plan and interpreted and administered by the Committee) while holding this Option which has
not expired and has not been fully exercised, the Participant may, at any time within five years of the date of the onset of such disability (but in no event after the expiration of this Option under Paragraph 2(a) above with respect to ten years

above, as to which the Participant could have exercised this Option on the date of the onset of such disability or retirement, or with respect to such greater number of shares as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion, and any remaining
portion of this Option shall be canceled by the Company. In the event the Participant&#146;s employment by the Company and its Affiliates or Related Employment terminates for reasons other than disability or retirement as described in this
Subparagraph 3(c) or death as described in Paragraph 4 below, this Option shall be canceled by the Company; provided, however, if within two years following a Change in Control (as defined in Section V of this Master Agreement), a Participant is
terminated under circumstances that would entitle the Participant to severance under an applicable U.S. severance plan (other than Constructive Termination, as defined in the applicable plan), the Participant may, at any time within 90 days
following such termination (but in no event after the expiration of this Option under Paragraph 2(a) above with respect to ten years from the Date of Grant), exercise this Option with respect to the number of shares as to which the Participant could
have exercised this Option on the date of such termination. For any other Participant not covered by a U.S. severance plan, the 90-day extension period shall apply if the Participant is terminated within two years following a Change in Control and
