provided, however, that effective with payments made in calendar year 2006 and thereafter, payments other than monthly annuity payments which would have been made on April&nbsp;1 of any year under the Prior Plan are made on July&nbsp;1 of such year.
Participants who were not in &#147;pay status&#148; as of January&nbsp;1, 2005 are governed from and after such date by the terms of the Plan, as amended and restated, and as further amended and restated from time to time. For purposes of this

&#147;Code&#148;). In connection with that transaction, the component of the Plan covering AFI participants was similarly transferred, and active and retired AFI participants and AFI beneficiaries ceased participation in and no longer have any
benefits under the Plan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:8%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(e) Generally effective July&nbsp;1, 2007, benefit accruals under the American Express Retirement Plan, as
