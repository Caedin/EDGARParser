Director for such year. Each SEU will have the value of a share of the Company&#146;s common stock, par value $0.20 per share (&#147;the Common Shares&#148;). At certain times the Company may be temporarily precluded from crediting Directors&#146;

such payment date, divided by (iii)&nbsp;the average market price of the Common Shares on the payment date. </FONT></P>
