&amp; Baldwin, Inc. (the "Company") considers it essential to the best interests
of the Company and its shareholders to encourage the continued employment of key
management personnel. In this connection, the Board of Directors of the Company
(the "Board") recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly-held
corporations, the possibility of a change in control of the Company may exist
and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise
among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management
personnel to the detriment of the Company and its
shareholders.&#160;&#160;Accordingly, the Board has determined that appropriate
steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and
dedication of members of the Company's top management, including you, to their
assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing
circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the
Company.</font></div>
