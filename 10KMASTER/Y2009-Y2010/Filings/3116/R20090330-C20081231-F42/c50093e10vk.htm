</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We manufacture and market diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals in specialty areas such
as ophthalmology, rheumatology, anesthesia and antidotes, among
others. In addition, we market and distribute vaccines purchased from
outside sources. Our customers include
physicians, optometrists, hospitals, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other
pharmaceutical companies. We are a Louisiana corporation founded in 1971 in Abita Springs,
Louisiana. In 1997, we relocated our headquarters and certain operations to Illinois. We have a
wholly owned subsidiary named Akorn (New Jersey), Inc., which operates in Somerset, New Jersey and
is involved in manufacturing, product development, and administrative activities related to our
ophthalmic and hospital drugs &#038; injectables segments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As described more fully herein, our losses from operations in recent years, working capital
deficiencies, limited capital resources and accumulated deficit, together with the restrictions on
our ability to borrow money under our credit agreement, raise substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. For further information, see Item&nbsp;8. Financial Statements and
Supplementary Data, Note A &#151; &#147;Business and Basis of Presentation&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
2007, we had three reporting segments. Our reportable segments are based upon internal financial
reports that disaggregate certain operating information. Our chief operating decision maker, as
defined in SFAS No.&nbsp;131, is our chief executive officer, or CEO.
Effective March 29, 2009, our Chief Financial Officer
(&#147;CFO&#148;) was appointed as our interim CEO, and as such,
 oversees operational assessments and resource allocations based upon the
results of our reportable segments, all of which have available discrete financial information. In
September&nbsp;2007, we introduced our adult Tetanus-Diphtheria (&#147;Td&#148;) vaccine. This product, as well as
other similar products we introduced since and plan to introduce, will be evaluated separately from
our other reportable segments. As such, we created a new reportable segment called biologics and
vaccines as of the fourth quarter of 2007. Accordingly, we have modified our method of operating
and evaluating our business units and, as a result, we modified our business reporting from three
identifiable reporting segments to four segments in accordance with SFAS 131. This had no impact
on prior year segment classifications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We classify our operations into four identifiable business segments, ophthalmic, hospital
drugs &#038; injectables, biologics &#038; vaccines and contract services. These four segments are described
in greater detail below. For information regarding revenues and gross profit for each of our
segments, see Item&nbsp;8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note L &#151; &#147;Segment Information.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Ophthalmic Segment. </I>We market a line of diagnostic and therapeutic ophthalmic pharmaceutical
products. Diagnostic products, primarily used in the office setting, include mydriatics and
cycloplegics, anesthetics, topical stains, gonioscopic solutions, angiography dyes and others.
Therapeutic products, sold primarily to wholesalers and other national account customers, include
antibiotics, anti-infectives, steroids, steroid combinations, glaucoma medications,
decongestants/antihistamines and anti-edema medications. Non-pharmaceutical products include
various artificial tear solutions, preservative-free lubricating ointments, eyelid cleansers,
vitamin supplements and contact lens accessories.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Hospital Drugs &#038; Injectables Segment. </I>We market a line of specialty injectable pharmaceutical
products, including antidotes, anesthesia, and products used in the treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis and pain management. These products are marketed to hospitals through wholesalers and
other national account customers as well as directly to medical specialists.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Biologics &#038; Vaccines Segment. </I>We market adult Td vaccines and we expanded into flu vaccine in
2008. We expect to add other vaccines produced by third party biologics manufacturers in the
future. These vaccines are marketed directly to hospitals and physicians as well as through
wholesalers and national distributors.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Contract Services Segment. </I>We manufacture products for third party pharmaceutical and
biotechnology customers based on their specifications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Manufacturing. </I>We have manufacturing facilities located in Decatur, Illinois and Somerset, New
Jersey. See Item&nbsp;2. Properties. We manufacture a diverse group of sterile pharmaceutical products,
including solutions, ointments and suspensions for our ophthalmic, hospital drugs &#038; injectables and
contract services segments. Our Decatur facility manufactures products for all three of these
segments. Our Somerset facility manufactures ophthalmic solutions and ointment products for our
ophthalmic and hospital drugs &#038; injectables segments. We have added freeze-dried (lyophilized)
manufacturing capabilities at our Decatur manufacturing facility and have validated the
lyophilization equipment for commercial production. We intend to
internally develop an Abbreviated
New Drug

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Sales and Marketing. </I>While we are working to expand our proprietary product base through
internal development and external product licensing development, the majority of our current
products are non-proprietary. We rely on our efforts in marketing, distribution, product
development and low cost manufacturing to maintain and increase our market share.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ophthalmic segment uses a three-tiered sales effort. Outside sales representatives sell
directly to retina surgeons and ophthalmic group practices. In-house sales (telemarketing)&nbsp;and
customer service (catalog sales) sell to office-based ophthalmic physicians and hospitals. A
national accounts group contracts with wholesalers, retail chains and other group purchasing
organizations that represent hospitals in the United States. We have a national accounts group and
hospital field sales team that markets our hospital drugs and injectables segment. Our national
accounts group, field sales, and telemarketing group handles marketing for our biologics and
vaccine products. Contract services markets our contract manufacturing services through direct
mail, trade shows and direct industry contacts.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Research and Development. </I>In June&nbsp;2007, we filed a New Drug Application (&#147;NDA&#148;) for
Akten<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP>, our ophthalmic anesthetic product, and we received an approval by the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;) for this product in October&nbsp;2008. In 2008, we received 22 ANDA/NDA
product approvals from the FDA. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had 23 ANDA product submissions for
generic pharmaceuticals under review at the Office of Generic Drugs: 13 from internal development
and 10 from various strategic agreements with four external partners. In most, but not all, instances
we own the ANDAs that are produced by our strategic partnerships. We plan to continue to file ANDAs
on a regular basis as pharmaceutical products come off patent allowing us to compete by marketing
generic equivalents. For more information, see &#147;Government Regulation&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2004, we began to enter into strategic partnerships for the development and marketing of a
number of products, a discussion of which is below:
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under an agreement we entered into in 2004 with Strides Arcolab Limited (&#147;Strides&#148;),
Akorn-Strides, LLC (the &#147;Joint Venture Company&#148;), of which we and Strides are both 50% owners, is
developing patent-challenge products and ANDA products for the U.S. hospital and retail markets. We
have each funded the Joint Venture Company with $1,500,000 for initial development projects. See
Item&nbsp;8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note P &#151; &#147;Business Alliances&#148; for more
information. As our strategic partner, Strides is responsible for developing, manufacturing and
supplying products that we will sell and market in the United States on an exclusive basis. We
launched certain of these products in the second half of 2008 with net sales totaling $2,024,000
for 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In October&nbsp;2004, we entered into an exclusive drug development and distribution agreement for
oncology drug products for the United States and Canada with Serum Institute of India, Ltd.
(&#147;Serum&#148;). Serum has completed the construction and commissioning of a new facility and associated
manufacturing processes, and has recently undergone a pre-approval/GMP inspection by the FDA.
Serum is waiting for the results of the inspection from the FDA, which will indicate whether Serum
has received approval of the site for manufacture of oncology products, destined for distribution
in the U.S. market. We will own the ANDAs for and buy the products developed under the agreement
from Serum under a negotiated transfer price arrangement. Once the products are approved, we will
market and sell them in the United States and Canada under our label.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2004, we entered into an Exclusive License and Supply Agreement with Hameln
Pharmaceuticals (&#147;Hameln&#148;) for two Orphan Drug NDAs &#151; Calcium-DTPA and Zinc-DTPA &#151; which were
both approved by the FDA in August&nbsp;2004. These products are antidotes for the treatment of
radioactive poisoning. Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a one-time license fee of
1,550,000 Euros ($2,095,000 at such time) for an exclusive license for five years, subject to
extension for successive two-year periods. Orphan drug exclusivity status is granted by the FDA for
a period of seven years from the date of approval of the NDA. Hameln manufactures both drugs, and
we market and distribute both drugs in the United States and Canada. We share revenues 50:50,
subject to adjustments. We pay any annual FDA establishment fees and for the cost of any
post-approval studies. On December&nbsp;30, 2005, we were awarded a $21,491,000 contract from the United
States Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) for these products which we subsequently
sold to HHS in March of 2006. In December&nbsp;2006, we sold HHS an additional $3,502,000 of these
products. Our 2008 and 2007 sales were $322,000 and $1,812,000, respectively, for these antidote
products, none of which were sales to HHS.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;7, 2006, we entered into a 10-year exclusive agreement with Cipla, Ltd. (&#147;Cipla&#148;), an
Indian pharmaceutical company located in Mumbai, India. Under the terms of the agreement, Cipla
manufactures and supplies Vancomycin, an oral capsule anti-infective ANDA drug product using our
formulation, and we are responsible for the ANDA regulatory submission and clinical development. We
also funded the purchase of specialized manufacturing equipment and paid Cipla milestone fees for
Cipla&#146;s

Cipla and Cipla agreed to supply this product to us on an exclusive basis in the United States. We
will own the ANDA in the United States. We are awaiting final FDA review and approval for generic
oral Vancomycin capsules.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;8, 2006, we entered into both a Development and Exclusive Distribution Agreement
(the &#147;Development and Exclusive Distribution Agreement&#148;) and a Development Funding Agreement
(&#147;Development Funding Agreement&#148; and together with the Development and Exclusive Distribution
Agreement, the &#147;Agreements&#148;) with Serum. Under the Agreements, Serum has agreed to appoint us as
the exclusive distributor for Rabies monoclonal antibody (the &#147;Product&#148;). In exchange for us
receiving exclusive marketing and distribution rights for the Product to North, Central, and South
America, we have agreed to help fund development of the Product through milestone payments. These
milestone payments are associated with the successful completion of Phase I, Phase II, and Phase
III clinical trials and receipt of approval for a biologics license application from the FDA&#146;s
Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. As the exclusive marketing and distribution partner
of Serum for the Product in the Americas, we will receive 40% of the revenues from Product sales in
North America and 50% of the revenues from Product sales in Central and South America. Also as part
of the Development and Exclusive Distribution Agreement, Serum granted us the first option right to
obtain exclusive marketing rights in North, Central, and South America for a second monoclonal
antibody product, Anti-D human monoclonal antibody (&#147;Anti-D&#148;). The exclusive marketing rights for
Anti-D would be consistent with the terms and conditions in the Agreements for the Product.
Additionally, Serum has granted us the first option right to expand the territory in which it has
exclusive rights to include Europe in exchange for minimum annual product sales requirements in
Europe.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;22, 2007, we entered into an Exclusive Distribution Agreement (the &#147;MBL Distribution
Agreement&#148;) with Massachusetts Biological Laboratories of the University of Massachusetts (&#147;MBL&#148;)
for distribution of Td vaccines. MBL manufactures the Td vaccine products and we market and
distribute the Td vaccine products on an exclusive basis in the United States and Puerto Rico. In
July&nbsp;2008, the MBL Distribution Agreement was amended to: (i)&nbsp;allow us to destroy our remaining
inventory of Td vaccine, 15 dose/vial, in exchange for receiving an equivalent number of doses of
preservative-free Td vaccine, 1 dose/vial (the &#147;Single-dose Product&#148;) at no additional cost other
than destruction and documentation expenses; (ii)&nbsp;reduce the aggregate purchase price of the
Single-dose Product during the first year of the MBL Distribution Agreement by approximately 14.4%;
(iii)&nbsp;reduce our purchase commitment for the second year of the MBL Distribution Agreement by
approximately 34.7%; and (iv)&nbsp;reduce our purchase commitment for the third year of the MBL
Distribution Agreement by approximately 39.5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were unable to make a payment of approximately $3,375,000 for Td vaccine products which was
due to our strategic partner, MBL, by February&nbsp;27, 2009 under our MBL Distribution Agreement.
While we made a partial payment of $1,000,000 to MBL on March&nbsp;13, 2009, we are also unable to make
another payment of approximately $3,375,000 due to MBL on March&nbsp;28, 2009. Accordingly, we have
entered into a letter agreement with MBL on March&nbsp;27, 2009 (&#147;MBL Letter Agreement&#148;), pursuant to
which we agreed to pay MBL the $5,750,000 remaining due for these Td vaccine products plus an
additional $4,750,000 in consideration of the amendments to the MBL Distribution Agreement payable
according to a periodic monthly payment schedule through June&nbsp;30, 2010. In addition, pursuant to the MBL
Letter Agreement, the MBL Distribution Agreement was converted to a non-exclusive agreement, we are
obligated to provide MBL with a standby letter of credit by April&nbsp;12, 2009 to secure our obligation
to pay amounts due to MBL, and we will be released from our obligation to further purchase Td
vaccine products from MBL upon providing MBL with such letter of credit. In addition, pursuant to
the MBL Letter Agreement, MBL agreed not to declare a breach or otherwise act to terminate the MBL
Distribution Agreement provided that we comply with the terms of the MBL Letter Agreement, the MBL
Distribution Agreement (as amended by the MBL Letter Agreement) and any agreements required to be
entered into pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement.
We anticipate that Dr. John Kapoor, the Chairman of our board
 of directors and one of our principal shareholders, will provide
the standby letter of credit to MBL pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement.
 If for any reason we are unable to provide the standby letter of credit to MBL
 by April 12, 2009 or if we are unable to make any payment under the MBL Letter Agreement
when due and MBL is unable to draw on the standby letter of credit, we would be in breach
of the MBL Letter Agreement.  We expect that Dr. Kapoor will be compensated in an amount to
be determined for providing the standby letter of credit.

in 2006 Hameln was our sole supplier of DTPA for our hospital drugs &#038; injectables segment. We
require a supply of quality raw materials and components to manufacture and package pharmaceutical
products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted. The principal
components of our products are active and inactive pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging
materials. Many of these components are available from only a single source and, in the case of
many of our ANDAs and NDAs, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified. Because FDA
approval of drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients
and certain packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal and McKesson are distributors of our products as well as a broad
range of health care products for many other companies. None of these distributors is an end user
of our products. If sales to any one of these distributors were to diminish or cease, we believe
that the end users of our products would find little difficulty obtaining our products either
directly from us or from another distributor. However, the loss of one or more of these
distributors, together with a delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for
end users, could have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and
results of operations. We consider our business relationships with these three wholesalers to be in
good standing and have fee for services contracts with each of these wholesalers. A change in
purchasing patterns, a decrease in inventory levels, an increase in returns of our products, delays
in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also could
have a material negative impact on our revenue, business, financial condition and results of
operations. See Item&nbsp;1A Risk factors &#151; &#147;We depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of
any of which could have a material adverse effect&#148; for more information.

current open backorders during 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Government Regulation. </I>Pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors are subject to extensive
regulation by government agencies, including the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration (&#147;DEA&#148;),
the Federal Trade Commission (&#147;FTC&#148;) and other federal, state and local agencies. The federal Food,
Drug and Cosmetic Act (the &#147;FDC Act&#148;), the Controlled Substance Act and other federal statutes and
regulations govern or influence the development, testing, manufacture, labeling, storage and
promotion of products that we manufacture and market. The FDA inspects drug manufacturers and
storage facilities to determine compliance with its current Good Manufacturing Practices (&#147;cGMP&#148;)
regulations, non-compliance with which can result in fines, recall and seizure of products, total
or partial suspension of production, refusal to approve NDAs and ANDAs and criminal prosecution.
The FDA also has the authority to revoke approval of drug products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FDA approval is required before any drug can be manufactured and marketed. New drugs require
the filing of an NDA, including clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the drug.
Generic drugs, which are equivalents of existing, off-patent brand name drugs, require the filing
of an ANDA. An ANDA does not, for the most part, require clinical studies since safety and efficacy
have already been demonstrated by the product originator. However, the ANDA must provide data
demonstrating the equivalency of

Letter&#148;) following a routine inspection of our Decatur, Illinois manufacturing facility conducted
from September&nbsp;12 through September&nbsp;29, 2006. The Warning Letter alleged violations of the current
cGMP regulations. We responded to the Warning Letter on April&nbsp;19, 2007 providing clarifying
information and describing corrective actions planned and/or completed. The Warning Letter had no
impact on FDA approved products manufactured or distributed by our Decatur facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA conducted another inspection of the Decatur facility from July&nbsp;23, 2007 to August&nbsp;17,
2007. The FDA investigators identified a number of observations representing potential violations
of the cGMP regulations. We submitted comprehensive responses to these observations on September
28, 2007. Subsequently, we were notified by the FDA on December&nbsp;20, 2007, that all cGMP issues had
been satisfactorily resolved resulting in removal of the Warning Letter&#146;s potential restrictions on
new product approvals; approval of the lyophilization and filling operations of the Decatur
facility; and approval of the site transfer for manufacture of IC Green to the Decatur facility.
Since then, we have received FDA approval of several ANDAs and NDAs for manufacture of product at
the Decatur facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Product Recalls. </I>We were prompted to initiate one product recall of our Cyanide Antidote Kit
during 2008, due to the third quarter recall notification by Becton, Dickinson and Company (&#147;BD&#148;),
of their 60ml syringe. This syringe is included as part of a packaged kit along with drug
components manufactured and sourced by us, to support the Cyanide Antidote Kit. Our recall of the
Cyanide Antidote Kit was necessitated by the BD recall, and has resulted in no patient impact and
no shortage of product supply to the marketplace. We recorded a $440,000 additional provision to
sales returns in 2008 to recognize the impact of this recall. Our supporting efforts were reviewed by the
FDA, as part of our due diligence in apprising the Agency of our reaction to the BD recall. There
were no product recalls during 2007 or 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>DEA Regulation. </I>We also manufacture and distribute several controlled-drug substances, the
distribution and handling of which are regulated by the DEA. Failure to comply with DEA regulations
can result in fines or seizure of product.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Environment</I>. We do not anticipate any material adverse effect from compliance with federal,
state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials
into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Foreign Sales</I>. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, approximately $1,384,000, $1,320,000 and
$1,104,000, respectively, of our revenues were from customers located in foreign countries.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Seasonality</I>. Most of our business segments do not experience significant seasonality other
than Td vaccines in the spring through fall seasons and flu vaccine products which are typically
sold in the August through November period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Government Contracts</I>. None of our business segments are generally subject to renegotiation of
profits or termination of contracts at the election of the Federal government.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our recent operating losses may continue in the future and there can be no assurance that our
financial outlook will improve. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our operating
losses were $7,183,000, $19,815,000 and $4,905,000, respectively. We generated a positive cash flow
from operations in 2006 of $2,509,000, however, we generated negative cash flows of $5,420,000 and
$24,891,000 in 2008 and 2007, respectively. If our results of operations do not improve we would

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our lack of liquidity, limited capital resources, continued losses and accumulated
debt, we have concluded that there is substantial
doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent registered
public accounting firm has included in their report on our December&nbsp;31, 2008 consolidated financial
statements which is included in this annual report on Form 10-K,  an explanatory paragraph
describing the events that have given rise to this uncertainty. These factors may make it more
difficult for us to obtain additional funding to meet our
obligations. Our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon our ability to generate or obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a
timely basis. Our losses since 2001 have totaled $85,128,000. Based on our operating plan, our
existing working capital is not sufficient to meet the cash requirements to fund our planned
operating expenses, capital expenditures, and working capital
requirements through December&nbsp;31, 2009
without additional sources of cash and/or the deferral, reduction or elimination of significant
planned expenditures. Currently, we have no commitments to obtain additional capital, and there can
be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at
all. See also &#147;Risks relating to our Credit Agreement&#148; and &#147;Inadequate liquidity could materially

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Our lender has restricted our ability to draw on our Credit Agreement. </I>We are party to a Credit
Agreement (&#147;GE Credit Agreement&#148;) with General Electric Capital Corporation (&#147;GE Capital&#148;), as
agent for the several financial institutions from time to time party to the Credit Agreement and
for itself as a lender, and GE Capital Markets, Inc. Pursuant to the GE Credit Agreement, among
other things, the lenders agreed to extend loans to us under a revolving credit facility (including
a letter of credit subfacility) up to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000 or whatever
lower figure is supported by the collateral borrowing base rules set forth in the GE Credit
Agreement. On February&nbsp;19, 2009, we received a letter from GE Capital informing us that GE Capital
was applying a reserve against availability which effectively restricts our borrowings under the GE
Credit Agreement to the balance outstanding as of February&nbsp;19, 2009, which was $5,523,620. GE
Capital advised us that it was applying this reserve due to concerns about our financial
performance, including our prospective compliance with the EBITDA covenant in the GE Credit
Agreement for the quarter that will end March&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The restrictions on our ability to borrow under the GE Credit Agreement could have important
adverse consequences on our future operations, including: making it more difficult for us to meet
our payment and other obligations; reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working
capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our
ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes; limiting our flexibility in planning
for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industries
in which we operate and the general economy; and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared
to our competitors that have fewer restrictions on borrowing or greater access to capital. If we
are unable to convince GE Capital to remove the restriction on our ability to borrow under the GE
Credit Agreement or obtain otherwise suitable financing, we may not be able to meet our payment and
other obligations which could significantly and materially harm our business and we may not be able
to continue as a going concern<B><I>. </I></B>There is no guarantee that we will be successful in convincing GE
Capital to remove the restriction on our ability to borrow or that we will be able to obtain
otherwise suitable financing.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>Our ability to continue as a going concern depends on our compliance with the terms of our Credit
Agreement, and on the availability of additional financing. </I>Our GE Credit Agreement contains a
number of agreements and covenants that we may not be able to comply with. Should a default be
declared, we would have to repay any money borrowed thereunder and this would threaten our ability
to continue as a going concern. Alternative financing could replace our relationship with GE
Capital, but if we are forced to seek that financing we do not believe it would be on favorable
terms and there can be no assurance as to the amount of any financing that might be available.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><I>We have received an extension from our lender pertaining to a loan covenant, but may not receive a
further extension or waiver of the covenant, which would entitle our lender to exercise default
remedies. </I>Our GE Credit Agreement requires us to enter into control agreements with respect to each
of our deposit, securities, commodity or similar accounts as our lenders shall reasonably request.
Failure to obtain such control agreements constitutes a default under the GE Credit Agreement. GE
Capital has extended the deadline

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">for entering into a control agreement for one of our accounts until March&nbsp;30, 2009. However, there
is no guarantee that we will be successful in obtaining such a control agreement or that GE Capital
will grant us a further extension of the deadline by March&nbsp;30, 2009. In the event of a
default resulting from the failure to obtain such a control agreement or extension, GE Capital will
have the option of exercising all of its rights and remedies under the GE Credit Agreement arising
as a result of the alleged events of default, including the right (i)&nbsp;to accelerate our loan obligations, (ii)&nbsp;to increase
the interest rate to the default rate under the GE Credit Agreement, and (iii)&nbsp;to repossess and take
other action with respect to any or all collateral under the GE Credit Agreement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Inadequate liquidity could materially adversely affect our business operations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We require substantial liquidity to implement long-term cost savings and restructuring plans,
continue capital spending to support product programs and development of advanced technologies,
meet scheduled term debt and lease maturities, and run our normal business operations. If we
continue to operate at or below the minimum cash levels necessary to support our normal business
operations, we may be forced to further curtail capital spending, research and development and
other programs that are important to the future success of our business. As discussed above, GE
Capital has responded to the weakening of our liquidity position by placing a restriction on our
ability to borrow under the GE Credit Agreement. It is likely that if we were to lose our ability
to access amounts under the GE Credit Agreement, that we would be unable to find additional capital
or alternative financing necessary to sustain our current business operations. If we fail to
obtain sufficient funding for any reason, we would not be able to continue as a going concern.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Our lack of liquidity has caused us to be unable to make payments when due under our Exclusive
Distribution Agreement with Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to our limited liquidity, we were unable to make a payment of approximately $3,375,000 for
Td vaccine products which was due to our strategic partner, MBL, by February&nbsp;27, 2009 under our MBL
Distribution Agreement. While we made a partial payment of $1,000,000 to MBL on March&nbsp;13, 2009, we
were also unable to make another payment of approximately $3,375,000 due to MBL on March&nbsp;28, 2009.
Accordingly, we have entered into a letter agreement with MBL on March&nbsp;27, 2009 (&#147;MBL Letter
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which we agreed to pay MBL the $5,750,000 remaining due for these Td
vaccine products plus an additional $4,750,000 in consideration of the amendments to the MBL
Distribution Agreement payable according to a periodic payment schedule through June&nbsp;30, 2010. In
addition, pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement, the MBL Distribution Agreement was converted to a
non-exclusive agreement, we are obligated to provide MBL with a standby letter of credit by April
12, 2009 to secure our obligation to pay amounts due to MBL, and we will be released from our
obligation to further purchase Td vaccine products from MBL upon providing MBL with such letter of
credit. In addition, pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement, MBL agreed not to declare a breach or
otherwise act to terminate the MBL Distribution Agreement provided that we comply with the terms of
the MBL Letter Agreement, the MBL Distribution Agreement (as amended by the MBL Letter Agreement)
and any agreements required to be entered into pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement. We anticipate that Dr.&nbsp;John Kapoor, the Chairman of our board of directors and one of our principal
shareholders, will provide the standby letter of credit to MBL pursuant to the MBL Letter
Agreement. If for any reason we are unable to provide the standby letter of credit to MBL by April
12, 2009 or if we are unable to make any payment under the MBL Letter Agreement when due and MBL is
unable to draw on the standby letter of credit, we would be in breach of the MBL Letter Agreement
which could significantly and materially harm our business and cause us to not be able to continue
as a going concern. We expect that Dr.&nbsp;Kapoor will be compensated in an amount to be determined
for providing the standby letter of credit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We must obtain additional capital to continue our operations.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will require additional funds to operate and grow our business. We may seek additional
funds through public and private financing, including equity and debt offerings. However, adequate
funds through the financial markets or from other sources may not be available when needed or on
terms favorable to us. Without sufficient additional funding, we may be required to delay, scale
back or abandon some or all of our product development, manufacturing, acquisition, licensing and
marketing initiatives, or operations. Further, such additional financing, if obtained, likely will
require the granting of rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of the common stock and
result in substantial dilution of the existing ownership interests of the common stockholders, and could include covenants and restrictions
that limit our ability to operate or expand our business in a manner that we deem to be in our best interest.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our general business strategy may be adversely affected by the recent economic downturn and
volatile business environment and continued unpredictable and unstable market conditions. If the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">downturn may result in adverse changes to product reimbursement, pricing or sales levels,
which would harm our operating results. There is a risk that one or more of our current service
providers, manufacturers and other partners may not survive these difficult economic times, which
would directly affect our ability to attain our operating goals on schedule and on budget. Failure
to secure any necessary financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms could have a material
adverse effect on our growth strategy, financial performance and stock price and could require us
to delay or abandon development plans. There is also a possibility that our stock price may
decline, due in part to the volatility of the stock market and the general economic downturn.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We have invested significant resources in the development of lyophilization manufacturing
capability, and we may not realize the benefit of these efforts and expenditures</B><B><I>.</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have completed the final stages of an expansion of our Decatur, Illinois manufacturing
facility to add capacity to provide lyophilization manufacturing services, a manufacturing
capability we previously did not have. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had spent $22,680,000 on the
lyophilization facility expansion. In December&nbsp;2006, we placed the sterile solutions portion of
this operation in service which augments our existing production capacities. The remaining
$5,443,000, which is specific to lyophilization (freeze-dry) operations was validated and placed in
service in December&nbsp;2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are producing our lyophilized IC Green product on this equipment and are working
to internally develop an
 ANDA lyophilized products pipeline. However, there is no guarantee that
we will be successful in attaining additional lyophilization customers or products, or that other
intervening events will not occur that reduce or eliminate the additional benefits from such
capability. For instance, the market for lyophilized products could significantly diminish or be
eliminated, or new technological advances could render the lyophilization process obsolete. There
can be no assurance that we will realize all the anticipated benefits from our significant
investment into lyophilization capability at our Decatur manufacturing facility, and our failure to
do so could significantly limit our ability to grow our business in the future.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>We depend on a small number of distributors, the loss of any of which could have a material adverse
effect.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small number of large wholesale drug distributors account for a large portion of our gross
sales, revenues and accounts receivable. The following three wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen,
Cardinal and McKesson, accounted for approximately 49% of total gross sales and 45% of total
revenues in 2008, and 54% of gross trade receivables as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. In addition to acting
as distributors of our products, these three companies also distribute a broad range of health care
products for many other companies. The loss of one or more of these wholesalers, together with a
delay or inability to secure an alternative distribution source for end users, could have a
material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations and lead to a violation of debt
covenants. A change in purchasing patterns, inventory levels, increases in returns of our products,
delays in purchasing products and delays in payment for products by one or more distributors also
could have a material negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Our growth depends on our ability to timely develop additional pharmaceutical products and
manufacturing capabilities.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our strategy for growth is dependent upon our ability to develop products that can be promoted
through current marketing and distributions channels and, when appropriate, the enhancement of such
marketing and distribution channels. We may not meet our anticipated time schedule for the filing
of ANDAs and NDAs or may decide not to pursue ANDAs or NDAs that we have submitted or anticipate
submitting. Our internal development of new pharmaceutical products is dependent upon the research
and development capabilities of our personnel and our strategic business alliance infrastructure.
There can be no assurance that we or our strategic business alliances will successfully develop new
pharmaceutical products or, if developed, successfully integrate new products into our existing
product lines. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will receive all necessary FDA
approvals or that such approvals will not involve delays, which adversely affect the marketing and
sale of our products. Our failure to develop new products, to maintain substantial compliance with
FDA compliance guidelines or to receive FDA approval of ANDAs or NDAs, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have entered several strategic business alliances that have been formed to supply us with
low cost finished dosage form products. Since 2004, we have entered into various purchase and
supply agreements, license agreements, and a joint venture that are all designed to provide
finished dosage form products that can be marketed through our distribution pipeline. The Joint
Venture Company has generated several product introductions, however, there can be no assurance
that these agreements will result in additional FDA-approved ANDAs or NDAs, or that we will be able
to market any such additional products at a profit. In addition, any clinical trial expenses that
we incur may result in adverse financial consequences to our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Our growth and profitability is dependent on our ability to successfully market and distribute new

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We continue to seek out and introduce new pharmaceutical/healthcare products. Our improved
financial performance is dependent on new product introductions, such as the biologics and vaccine
products discussed above. Any delays or an inability to successfully market and distribute such
products may result in adverse financial consequences to our business. In particular, continued
growth for our Td vaccine product is dependent on successful management of market penetration on
hospital group purchasing organization contracts.

In addition, we have lost our exclusive distribution rights for this Td vaccine product as per the MBL Letter
Agreement dated March 27, 2009.
 While we
anticipate selling at prices in excess of our carrying value, extensive discounting to generate
cash for our operations and/or discounting to respond to competitor pricing could be required and,
if so, this would adversely impact our profit margins which could
impact our ability to continue as a going concern.

particularly susceptible to competition, substitution policies and reimbursement policies.</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate which branded pharmaceuticals are
about to come off patent and thus permit us to develop, manufacture and market equivalent generic
pharmaceutical products. Generic pharmaceuticals must meet the same quality standards as branded
pharmaceuticals, even though these equivalent pharmaceuticals are sold at prices that are
significantly lower than that of branded pharmaceuticals. Generic substitution is regulated by the
federal and state governments, as is reimbursement for generic drug dispensing. There can be no
assurance that substitution will be permitted for newly approved generic drugs or that such
products will be subject to government reimbursement. In addition, generic products that third
parties develop may render our generic products noncompetitive or obsolete. There can be no
assurance that we will be able to consistently bring generic pharmaceutical products to market
quickly and efficiently in the future. An increase in competition in the sale of generic
pharmaceutical products or our failure to bring such products to market before our competitors
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, there is no proprietary protection for most of the branded pharmaceutical products
that either we or other pharmaceutical companies sell. In addition, governmental and
cost-containment pressures regarding the dispensing of generic equivalents will likely result in
generic substitution and competition generally for our branded pharmaceutical products. We attempt
to mitigate the effect of this substitution through, among other things, creation of strong
brand-name recognition and product-line extensions for our branded pharmaceutical products, but
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.

commercially acceptable terms, we may not be able to distribute certain of our products as planned.
No assurance can be made that the manufacturers we use will be able to provide us with sufficient
quantities of our products or that the products supplied to us will meet our specifications. Any

directors. On January&nbsp;29, 2009 Arthur Przybyl vacated the positions of President and Chief
Executive Officer. On this same date, the board of directors formed a committee to oversee our
operations until a new President and Chief Executive Officer is appointed and begins service in
those positions. The committee is comprised of Dr.&nbsp;John Kapoor, Chairman of the board of

development personnel, other technical employees, managers and sales personnel and our ability to
continue to attract and retain such personnel. Competition for such personnel is intense,
particularly for highly motivated and experienced research and development and other technical
personnel. We are facing increasing competition from companies with greater financial resources for
such personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain sufficient

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Federal and state government agencies regulate virtually all aspects of our business. The
development, testing, manufacturing, processing, quality, safety, efficacy, packaging, labeling,
record keeping, distribution, storage and advertising of our products, and disposal of waste
products arising from such activities, are subject to regulation by the FDA, DEA, FTC, the Consumer
Product Safety Commission, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Environmental
Protection Agency. Similar state and local agencies also have jurisdiction over these activities.
Noncompliance with applicable United States and/or state or local regulatory requirements can
result in fines, injunctions, penalties, mandatory recalls or seizures, suspensions of production,
recommendations by the FDA against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution. Any of these
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. New, modified and additional regulations, statutes or legal interpretation, if any,

to enjoin non-complying activities, to halt manufacturing operations that are not in compliance
with cGMP, to recall products, to seek civil and monetary penalties and to criminally prosecute

or prohibition on sales of products we market or the halting of our manufacturing operations, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In
addition, product recalls may be issued at our discretion, or at the request of the FDA or other
government agencies having regulatory authority for pharmaceutical products. Recalls may occur due
to disputed labeling claims, manufacturing issues, quality defects or other reasons. No assurance
can be given that restriction or prohibition on sales, halting of manufacturing operations or

material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further,
such actions, in certain circumstances, could constitute an event of default under the terms of our
various financing relationships.

approval is never certain. Our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect
to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval. Even if the FDA or another regulatory
agency approves a product, the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product, may otherwise
limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute a product or may require post-marketing studies
or impose other post-marketing obligations.

regulatory compliance regarding the manufacturing, distribution, and promotion of pharmaceutical

pharmaceutical products to ensure their safety and efficacy. The FDA also regulates drug labeling
and the advertising of prescription drugs. A finding by a governmental agency or court that we are
not in compliance with FDA requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We were previously subject to an FDA Warning Letter which the FDA issued to us in October&nbsp;2000
which was subsequently removed in 2005. In March&nbsp;2007, we were again subject to a warning letter at
our Decatur facility which was removed in December&nbsp;2007. See Item&nbsp;1. Business &#151; &#147;FDA Warning

approvals for their manufacture and sale. In addition, modifications or enhancements of approved
products are in many circumstances subject to additional FDA approvals which may or may not be
granted and which may be subject to a lengthy application process. Any change in the FDA&#146;s
enforcement policy or any decision by the FDA to require an approved NDA or ANDA for one of our
products not currently subject to the approved NDA or ANDA requirements or any delay in the FDA
approving an NDA or ANDA for one of our products could have a material adverse effect on our

without FDA-issued ANDAs or NDAs on the basis of their having been marketed prior to the 1962
Amendment of the FDC Act. The regulatory
status of these products is subject to change and/or challenge by the FDA, which could establish
new standards and limitations for manufacturing and marketing such products, or challenge the
evidence of prior manufacturing and marketing upon which grandfathering status is based. Any such
change in the status of such product could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

federal Controlled Substances Act and similar state laws, which impose, among other things, certain
licensing, security and record keeping requirements administered by the DEA and similar state
agencies, as well as quotas for the manufacture, purchase and sale of controlled substances. The

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceuticals involves an inherent risk that our products
may prove to be defective and cause a health risk. In that event, we may voluntarily implement a

products in the past and, based on this experience, believe that the occurrence of a recall could
result in significant costs to us, potential disruptions in the supply of our products to our
customers and adverse publicity, all of which could harm our ability to market our products. We
were prompted to initiate one product recall of our Cyanide Antidote Kit during 2008, due to the

from running our business. Successful product liability claims brought against us could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

claims with a $50,000 deductible per incident and a $250,000 aggregate annual deductible. However,
there can be no assurance that such insurance coverage will be sufficient to fully cover potential
claims. Additionally, there can be no assurance that adequate insurance coverage will be available
in the future at acceptable costs, if at all, or that a product liability claim would not have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From time to time, the FDA elects to permit sales of some pharmaceuticals currently sold on a

our profits.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We face significant competition from other pharmaceutical companies, including major
pharmaceutical companies with financial resources substantially greater than ours, in developing,
acquiring, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. The selling prices of
pharmaceutical products typically decline as competition increases. Further, other products now in
use, under development or acquired by other pharmaceutical companies, may be more effective or
offered at lower prices than our current or future products. The industry is characterized by rapid
technological change that may render our products obsolete, and competitors may develop their
products more rapidly than we can. Competitors may also be able to complete the regulatory process
sooner, and therefore, may begin to market their products in advance of our products. We believe
that competition in sales of our products is based primarily on price, service and technical
capabilities. There can be no assurance that: (i)&nbsp;we will be able to develop or acquire
commercially attractive pharmaceutical products; (ii)&nbsp;additional competitors will not enter the
market; or (iii)&nbsp;competition from other pharmaceutical companies will not have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

pharmaceutical products for ourselves and for third parties with which we have contracted. Many of
the raw materials and components used in our products come from a single source and interruptions
in the supply of these raw materials and components could disrupt our manufacturing of specific
products and cause our sales and profitability to decline. Further, in the case of many of our
ANDAs and NDAs, only one supplier of raw materials has been identified. Because FDA approval of
drugs requires manufacturers to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain
packaging materials in their applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if
active ingredients or such packaging materials were no longer available from the specified
supplier. The qualification of a new supplier could delay our development and marketing efforts. If
for any reason we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or

generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and is the subject of
much litigation. There can be no assurance that any patent applications or other proprietary
rights, including licensed rights, relating to our potential products or processes will result in
patents being issued or other proprietary rights secured, or that the resulting patents or
proprietary rights, if any, will provide protection against competitors who: (i)&nbsp;successfully
challenge our patents or proprietary rights; (ii)&nbsp;obtain patents or proprietary rights that may
have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business; or (iii)&nbsp;are able to circumvent our
patent or proprietary rights position. It is possible that other parties have conducted or are
conducting research and could make discoveries of pharmaceutical formulations or processes that
would precede any discoveries made by us, which could prevent us from obtaining patent or other
protection for these discoveries or marketing products developed there from. Consequently, there
can be no assurance that others will not independently develop pharmaceutical products similar to
or obsoleting those that we are planning to develop, or duplicate any of our products. Our
inability to obtain patents for, or other proprietary rights in, our products and processes or the
ability of competitors to circumvent or obsolete our patents or proprietary rights could have a

Because our market price has fallen below $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock may be
subject to the &#147;penny stock&#148; rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny
stock to be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to
certain exceptions. These rules would require that any broker-dealer that would recommend
our common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors, must, prior to the
sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser&#146;s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the
regulations would require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a
disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the
penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the
broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they
offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;23, 2009, the market price of our common stock did not exceed $5.00 per share.
Because our market price has fallen below $5.00 per share, trading in our common stock is subject
to the &#147;penny stock&#148; rules. The SEC has adopted regulations that generally define a penny stock to
be any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain
exceptions. These rules would require that any broker-dealer that would recommend our
common stock to persons other than prior customers and accredited investors, must, prior to the
sale, make a special written suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the
purchaser&#146;s written agreement to execute the transaction. Unless an exception is available, the
regulations would require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a
disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the risks associated with trading in the
penny stock market. In addition, broker-dealers must disclose commissions payable to both the
broker-dealer and the registered representative and current quotations for the securities they
offer. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage
broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could severely limit the
market price and liquidity of our common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of March&nbsp;23, 2009, we had 90,124,548 shares of common stock outstanding, which were held by
approximately 498 stockholders of record. This number does not include stockholders for which
shares are held in a &#147;nominee&#148; or &#147;street&#148; name. The closing price of our common stock on March&nbsp;23,
2009 was $1.40 per share. The transfer agent for our common stock is Computershare Investor
Services, LLC, located at 350 Indiana Street, Suite&nbsp;750, Golden, Colorado 80407.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not pay cash dividends in 2008, 2007, or 2006 and do not expect to pay dividends on our
common stock in the foreseeable future. Moreover, we are currently prohibited from making any
dividend payment under the terms of our various financing relationships. See Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; &#147;Financial Condition
and Liquidity&#148; for more information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the fourth quarter of the fiscal
year covered by this report.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;23, 2005, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No.333-127794) (the
&#147;S-3&#148;) with the SEC, which was declared effective on September&nbsp;7, 2005. Pursuant to Rule&nbsp;429 under
the Securities Act of 1933, the prospectus included in the S-3 is a combined prospectus and relates
to the previously filed Registration Statement on Form S-1 (File No.333-119168) (the &#147;S-1&#148;), as to
which the S-3 constitutes Post-Effective Amendment No.&nbsp;3. Such Post-Effective Amendment became
effective concurrently with the effectiveness of the S-3. The S-3 relates to the resale of
64,964,680 shares, no par value per share, of our common stock by the selling stockholders
identified in the S-3, which have been issued or reserved for issuance upon the conversion or
exercise of shares of our Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, shares of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, warrants
and convertible notes, including shares estimated to be issuable<U> </U>or that have been issued
in satisfaction of accrued and unpaid dividends and interest on shares of preferred stock and
convertible notes, respectively. Of the 64,964,680 shares of our common stock registered under the
S-3, 60,953,394 of such shares were registered under

Preferred Stock, Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, warrants and convertible notes described in the
Registration Statement, including shares estimated to be issuable in satisfaction of dividends
accrued and unpaid through December&nbsp;31, 2007 on such securities. All shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred
Stock, Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock and all convertible notes have been converted to shares of our
common stock.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With respect to the S-1, we estimated the aggregate offering price of the amount registered to
be $182,246,053, which was derived from the average of the bid and asked prices of our common stock
on September&nbsp;17, 2004, as reported on the OTC Bulletin Board(R). With respect to the S-3, we
estimated the aggregate offering price of the amount registered to be $10,870,585, which was
derived from the average of the high and low prices of our common stock as reported on the American
Stock Exchange on August&nbsp;18, 2005. Such amounts were estimated solely for the purpose of
calculating the amount of the registration fee pursuant to Rule 457(h) under the Securities Act of
1933. As of March&nbsp;6, 2009, we are aware of the sale of 20,507,709 shares of common stock by selling
stockholders under the S-3 or the S-1. We do not know at what price such shares were sold, or how
many shares of common stock will be sold in the future or at what price. We have not and will not
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the shares by the selling stockholders. The selling
stockholders will receive all of the proceeds from the sale of the shares and will pay all
underwriting discounts and selling commissions, if any, applicable to the sale of the shares. We
will, in the ordinary course of business, receive proceeds from the issuance of shares upon
exercise of the warrants described in the S-3 or the S-1, which we will use for working capital and
other general corporate purposes.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the 1988 Incentive Compensation Program (the &#147;Incentive Program&#148;) which expired November
2, 2003, our officers and employees were eligible to receive options as designated by our Board of
Directors. The Akorn, Inc. 2003 Stock Option Plan (&#147;2003 Stock Option Plan&#148;), which replaced the
Incentive Program, was approved by our Board of Directors on November&nbsp;6, 2003 and approved by our
stockholders on July&nbsp;8, 2004. Under the 2003 Stock Option Plan, 2,519,000 options have been granted
and 611,000 remain outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. On March&nbsp;29, 2005, our Board of Directors
approved the Amended and Restated Akorn, Inc. 2003 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;Amended 2003 Plan&#148;),
effective as of April&nbsp;1, 2005, and this was subsequently approved by our stockholders on May&nbsp;27,
2005. The Amended 2003 Plan is an amendment and restatement of the 2003 Stock Option Plan and
provides us with the ability to grant other types of equity awards to eligible participants besides
stock options. Commencing May&nbsp;27, 2005, all new awards have been granted under the Amended 2003
Plan. The aggregate number of shares of our common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards
granted under the Amended 2003 Plan is 5,000,000. Under the Amended 2003 Plan, 3,593,000 options
have been granted to employees and directors and 3,073,000 remain outstanding as of December&nbsp;31,
2008. Options granted under the Incentive Program, the 2003 Stock Option Plan, and the Amended
2003 Plan have exercise prices equivalent to the market value of our common stock on the date of
grant and generally vest over a period of three years and expire within a period of five years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>RESULTS OF OPERATIONS</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our lack of liquidity, limited capital resources, continued operating losses
and accumulated debt, we have concluded there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as
a going concern, and accordingly, our independent registered public accounting firm has modified
their report on our December&nbsp;31, 2008 consolidated financial statements included in this annual
report on Form 10-K in the form of an explanatory paragraph describing the events that have given
rise to this uncertainty. These factors may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional
funding to meet our obligations. Our continuation is dependent upon our ability to generate or
obtain sufficient cash to meet our obligations on a timely basis. Our losses since 2001 have
totaled $85,128,000. Based on our operating plan, our existing working capital is not sufficient
to meet the cash requirements to fund our planned operating expenses, capital expenditures, and
working capital requirements though December&nbsp;31, 2009 without additional sources of cash and/or the
deferral, reduction or elimination of significant planned expenditures. We are evaluating
alternatives for cost reduction as well as certain efficiency and cost containment measures to
improve our profitability and cash flow. In addition, we are actively seeking additional financing
for our operations. Currently, we have no commitments to obtain additional capital, and there can
be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at
all. See Item&nbsp;1A. &#147;Risks relating to our Credit Agreement&#148; and &#147;Inadequate liquidity could
materially adversely affect our business operations in the future&#148;.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management has previously reduced our cost structure, improved our processes and systems and
implemented new controls over capital and operational spending and we will continue such cost
reduction and efficiency measures along with targeted working capital
improvements. We anticipate
sales growth through our internal product development efforts, additional contract services
opportunities which we are actively pursuing and ongoing progress we are achieving with our
strategic partners on new products development. Management believes that continued emphasis on
these activities will benefit our results of operations, cash flow from operations and our future
prospects.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
2007, we had three reporting segments. Our reportable segments are based upon internal financial
reports that disaggregate certain operating information. Our chief operating decision maker, as
defined in SFAS No.&nbsp;131, is our chief executive officer, or CEO.
Effective March 29, 2009, our CFO was appointed as our interim CEO,
and as such, oversees operational assessments
and resource allocations based upon the results of our reportable segments, all of which have
available discrete financial information. In September&nbsp;2007, we introduced our adult
Tetanus-Diphtheria (&#147;Td&#148;) vaccine. This product, as well as other similar products we introduced
since and plan to introduce, will be evaluated separately from our other reportable segments. As
such, we created a new reportable segment called biologics and vaccines as of the fourth quarter of
2007. Accordingly, we have modified our method of operating and evaluating our business units
and, as a result, we modified our business reporting from three identifiable reporting segments to
four segments in accordance with SFAS 131. This had no impact on prior year segment
classifications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our revenues are derived from sales of diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals in our
ophthalmic segment, from sales of diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals in our hospital drugs
and injectables segment, from sales of vaccines, and from contract services revenue.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth the percentage relationships that certain items from our
Consolidated Statements of Operations bear to revenues for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007
and 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>COMPARISON OF TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated revenues increased 77%, or $40,703,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008
compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased sales of Td vaccine and the launch of Flu
vaccine along with moderate increases in other product segments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccine sales increased by $37,080,000 of which $30,700,000 related to our Td vaccine products
and $6,380,000 related to our initial launch of our Flu vaccine products. Ophthalmic segment
revenues increased 10%, or $1,902,000, primarily due to increased sales from a new ophthalmic
solution launched in the first quarter of 2008 and sales of Akten<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP>, a new topical
ophthalmic drug launched in the fourth quarter of 2008. Hospital drugs and injectables segment
revenues increased 1% or $152,000 for the year, reflecting the increased sales of anesthesia and
antidote products. Contract services revenues increased by 21%, or $1,569,000, mainly due to
increased order volumes on ophthalmic contract products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chargeback and rebate expense, a component of net revenues, for the year ended December
31, 2008, decreased to $31,330,000 from $31,971,000 in 2007. This decrease was primarily due to
product mix and increased sales volumes through distributors which do not generate chargebacks.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008, our product sales returns increased by $2,549,000 and was due to increased sales,
$524,000 for a phase-out of multi-dose Td vaccine, $440,000 for a product recall due to a
supplier&#146;s syringe included in our Cyanide Antidote Kit product, refinements in the lag analysis
used to estimate our product returns reserve (See Critical Accounting Policies &#151; &#147;Allowance for
Product Returns&#148; below), and less favorable wholesaler returns experience.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year-to-date consolidated gross profit of $26,592,000 was 28% of net revenues for 2008 as
compared to a gross profit of $11,400,000 or 22% for 2007, mainly due to the $13,210,000 of gross
profit contributed by vaccine sales combined with the sales increases for each segment discussed
above. The higher gross profit percentage was due to lower purchase costs for unit dose Td vaccine,
partially offset by lower margin Flu vaccine sales. The gross profit of our ophthalmic segment
increased $1,968,000 or 52% due to our launch of our new ophthalmic products including
Akten<SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">TM</SUP>. Our hospital drugs and injectables segment gross profit increased $58,000 or 1%
mainly due to increased mix of antidote sales. Our biologics &#038; vaccines segment gross profit was
$13,210,000 or 30% due to our continued growth of market share for Td vaccine and launch of flu
vaccines in 2008 and the shift to higher margin unit dose Td versus the multi-dose Td sold in 2007.
Our contract services segment gross profit increased $701,000 or 37% from the prior year mainly
due to stronger volumes on contract ophthalmic products.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative (&#147;SG&#038;A&#148;) expenses increased 17%, to $25,620,000 for 2008
from $21,861,000 for 2007. The key components of this increase in 2008 were $1,846,000 for
additional field and vaccine sales representatives and related selling expenses, $720,000 related
to increased technical consulting and professional fees, $394,000 for increased advertising and
sales meeting expenses, $393,000 for increased FDA facility and product fees, and $563,000 for
increased building rent related to our new Gurnee, Illinois warehouse and Lake Forest, Illinois
corporate headquarters, offset by decreased SFAS 123(R) stock compensation expense of $754,000 and
decreased recruiting and relocation fees of $384,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Research and development (&#147;R&#038;D&#148;) expense decreased, by $1,049,000 or 13% in 2008, to
$6,801,000 from $7,850,000 for the year 2007, mainly due to reduced product development activities
and reduced milestone payments to our strategic business partners ($2,948,000). These reductions
were partially offset by the first quarter 2008 write-off of certain product related filing and
license

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Net interest expense in 2008 was $870,000 as compared to interest income of $649,000 for 2007
as a result of increased borrowings against our Credit Facility and lower average balances on
short-term investments.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred income tax assets to the amount that

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated revenues decreased 26%, or $18,355,000 for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2007
compared to the prior year, mainly due to the $25,464,000 of sales of injectable radiation antidote
products (&#147;DTPA&#148;) to the United States Department of Health and Human Services (&#147;HHS&#148;) in 2006,
partially offset by the new product launch of vaccines in September&nbsp;2007 which resulted in
$7,522,000 of vaccine product sales in 2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ophthalmic segment revenues decreased 5%, or $983,000, primarily due to reduced sales of
diagnostic and anesthetic products. Hospital drugs and injectables segment revenues decreased 54%
or $23,014,000 for the year, reflecting the decreased volumes of anesthesia and antidote products.
In particular, sales of DTPA radiation antidote products to HHS were a primary driver for the sales
decrease in this category. This large order level for DTPA did not recur in 2007, although we do
anticipate continued orders for this antidote product. Sales of vaccines were introduced in the
third quarter of 2007, with total sales of $7,522,000 for the year. Contract services revenues
decreased by 20%, or $1,880,000, mainly due to decreased order volumes on contract products
resulting from customer concerns with an FDA warning letter issued in March&nbsp;2007 which was
subsequently removed in December&nbsp;2007.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chargeback and rebate expense, a component of net revenues, for the year ended December
31, 2007, increased to $31,971,000 from $26,295,000 in 2006, due to a higher percentage of sales to
wholesalers, a general increase in the product sales mix of higher chargeback and rebate percentage
items along with increased price competition. Note that sales of our DTPA antidote product to HHS
were not subject to chargeback or rebate expense. In 2007, our product sales returns declined by
$3,251,000 as we experienced an overall improvement on general product returns and, in addition, we
assembled a team of key managers for a concerted effort to improve the inventory turnover and
manage the stocking levels at our major customers to reduce product expiration returns.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consolidated gross profit of $11,400,000 was 22% of net revenues for 2007 as compared to a
gross profit of $26,880,000 or 38% for 2006. The gross profit of our ophthalmic segment decreased
$2,285,000 or 38% due to a less favorable product mix and increased price competition. Our hospital
drugs and injectables segment gross profit decreased $13,123,000 or 72% mainly due to decreased
sales of DTPA radiation antidote products to HHS as noted above and a less favorable product mix.
Our biologics &#038; vaccines segment gross profit was $745,000 or 10% due to current competitive market
conditions. Our contract services segment gross profit decreased $817,000 or 30% from the prior
year mainly due to lower sales resulting from customer concerns regarding the March&nbsp;2007 warning
letter from the FDA which was lifted in December&nbsp;2007. Our inventory at December&nbsp;31, 2007 included
a higher proportion of certain ophthalmic and hospital drugs &#038; injectable products which, on
average, sell below their carrying value and, as a result, we increased our inventory reserve
provision by $679,000 in 2007 to value these inventories at their net realizable value which
decreased our overall gross profit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Selling, general and administrative (&#147;SG&#038;A&#148;) expenses increased 18%, to $21,861,000 for 2007
from $18,603,000 for 2006. The key components of this increase in 2007 were the addition of 25
field and vaccine sales representatives and related selling expenses of $1,794,000, along with an
increase in administrative compensation expense of $385,000 related to newly hired employees, an
increase in FAS 123R stock compensation expense of $1,366,000 and an increase in administrative
travel of $419,000, partially offset by a decrease in bonus expense of $1,346,000 (no bonuses were
awarded for 2007).

$7,850,000 from $11,797,000 for the year 2006, mainly due to a reduction in validation testing and
development of our lyophilization processes and spending for new product development, which was

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the factors outlined above, we have experienced operating losses in 2008 and
2007 of $7,183,000 and $19,815,000, respectively, and the net losses for these years were
$7,939,000 and $19,168,000, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had cash and cash equivalents of $1,063,000. Our net working
capital at December&nbsp;31, 2008 was $22,643,000 versus a net working capital of $24,722,000 at
December&nbsp;31, 2007, resulting primarily from a decrease in cash levels partially offset by a
corresponding reduction in accounts payable for Td vaccine purchases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, we used $5,420,000 in cash from operations as the net
loss of $7,939,000 and reduction in trade accounts payable of $5,275,000 was partially offset by
non-cash expenses of $6,981,000 for the period. During 2007, we used $24,891,000 in cash from
operations as the net loss and increased inventory level was only partially offset by non-cash
expenses of $7,696,000 for the period, and a higher accounts payable level. Investing activities
for 2008 generated a $3,787,000 reduction in cash flow mainly due to capital expenditures for new
leased facilities and production equipment as well as $507,000 in funding to the Joint Venture
Company. Investing activities during 2007 required $2,184,000 in cash mainly due to capital
expenditures for production equipment. Financing activities for 2008 provided $2,322,000 in cash
primarily due to $5,000,000 in proceeds from the Subordinated Note issued to the Kapoor Trust in
July&nbsp;2008 and $1,250,000 in restricted cash which was released in December&nbsp;2008, partially offset
by the $4,521,000 net payoff of our Credit Facility in December&nbsp;2008. Financing activities for
2007 provided $13,205,000 in cash primarily due to $6,994,000 net proceeds from the November&nbsp;2007
private placement of common stock with Serum and $4,521,000 of net borrowings from the Credit
Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;8, 2006 we issued 4,311,669 shares of our common stock in a private placement with
various investors at a price of $4.50 per share which included warrants to purchase 1,509,088
additional shares of common stock. The aggregate offering price of the private placement was
approximately $19,402,000 and the net proceeds to us, after payment of approximately $1,324,000 of
commissions and expenses, was approximately $18,078,000, which were used to reduce debt and fund
additional product development activities and build a fund for future product development spending.
In September&nbsp;2006, we issued 1,000,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement with Serum
at a price of $3.56 per share. The offering price was $3,560,000 and the net proceeds to us, after
payment of approximately $17,000 in expenses, were approximately $3,543,000. In November&nbsp;2007, we
issued an additional 1,000,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement with Serum at a
price of $7.01 per share. The offering price was $7,010,000 and the net proceeds to us, after
payment of approximately $16,000 in expenses, were approximately $6,994,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had $1,063,000 in cash and our Credit Facility with Bank of
America expired on January&nbsp;1, 2009. On January&nbsp;7, 2009, we entered into a Credit Agreement (&#147;GE
Credit Agreement&#148;) with General Electric Capital Corporation (&#147;GE Capital&#148;) as agent for several
financial institutions (the &#147;Lenders&#148;). On February&nbsp;19, 2009, GE Capital informed us that it was
applying a reserve against availability, which effectively restricts our borrowings under the GE
Credit Agreement to the balance that was outstanding as of February&nbsp;19, 2009 (See &#147;Credit Facility&#148;
below). The restriction on our GE Credit Agreement has severely limited our working capital and
capital resources.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of our lack of liquidity, limited capital resources,
continued operating losses and accumulated debt, we have
concluded there is substantial doubt as to
our ability to continue as a going concern.
See Item 1A. &#147;Risks relating to our Credit Agreement&#148; and &#147;Inadequate liquidity could
materially adversely affect our business operations in the
future&#148;. </div>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Credit Facility</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2003, we entered into a credit agreement with Bank of America National
Association (&#147;Bank of America&#148;) providing us with a revolving line of credit (the &#147;Credit
Facility&#148;) secured by substantially all of our assets. The Credit Facility contained certain
restrictive covenants including but not limited to certain financial covenants such as minimum
EBITDA and certain other ratios. Because the Credit Facility also required us to maintain our
deposit accounts with Bank of America, the existence of these subjective covenants, pursuant to
EITF Abstract No.&nbsp;95-22, required that we classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility
as a current liability. The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% during
2008. There was a $0 balance on the Credit Facility at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and a $4,521,000 balance
at December&nbsp;31, 2007. The revolving commitment under the Credit Facility, as amended on November
2, 2007, was $15,000,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
wrote off certain previously capitalized product related filing and license fees in the first quarter of 2008
totaling $1,246,000. As a result, we were not in compliance with our Credit Facility covenants and
we requested and received an amendment from Bank of America dated May&nbsp;9, 2008 which adjusted the
EBITDA covenant calculation to exclude these additional research and development expense items. We
repaid our revolving line of credit with Bank of America at the end of December&nbsp;2008. The Credit
Facility expired on January&nbsp;1, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;7, 2009, we entered into a Credit Agreement (&#147;GE Credit Agreement&#148;) with General
Electric Capital Corporation (&#147;GE Capital&#148;) as agent for several financial institutions (the
&#147;Lenders&#148;). Pursuant to the GE Credit Agreement, among other things, the Lenders have agreed to
extend loans to us under a revolving credit facility (including a letter of credit subfacility) up
to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000 (the &#147;GE Credit Facility&#148;). At our election,
borrowings under the GE Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either: (i)&nbsp;the Base Rate
(defined as the highest of the Wall Street Journal prime rate, the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or
LIBOR plus 1.0%), plus a margin equal to (x)&nbsp;4% for the period commencing on the closing date
through April&nbsp;14, 2009, or (y)&nbsp;a percentage that ranges between 3.75% and 4.25% for the period
after April&nbsp;14, 2009, or (ii)&nbsp;LIBOR (or 2.75%, if LIBOR is less than 2.75%), plus a margin equal to
(x)&nbsp;5% for the period commencing on the closing date through April&nbsp;14, 2009, or (y)&nbsp;a percentage
that ranges between 4.75% and 5.25% for the period after April&nbsp;14, 2009. Upon the occurrence of any
event of default, we shall pay interest equal to an additional 2.0% per annum. The GE Credit
Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants customary for financings of this
type. The negative covenants include, without limitation, restrictions on liens, indebtedness,
payments of dividends, disposition of assets, fundamental changes, loans and investments,
transactions with affiliates and negative pledges. The financial covenants include fixed charge
coverage ratio, minimum-EBITDA, minimum liquidity and a maximum level of capital expenditures. In
addition, our obligations under the GE Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of
an event of default under the GE Credit Agreement, which includes customary events of default
including, without limitation, payment defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and
negative covenants, the inaccuracy of representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency
related defaults, defaults relating to judgments, defaults relating to certain governmental
enforcement actions, and a change of control default. The Credit Facility shall terminate, and all amounts
outstanding thereunder shall be due and payable, on January&nbsp;7, 2013, or on an earlier date as
specified in the GE Credit Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on January&nbsp;7, 2009, in connection with the GE Credit Agreement, we entered into a
Guaranty and Security Agreement (&#147;Guaranty and Security Agreement&#148;) by and among us, GE Capital, as
agent for the Lenders and each other secured party thereunder. Pursuant to the Guaranty and
Security Agreement, we have granted a security interest to GE Capital in the collateral described
in the Guaranty and Security Agreement as security for the GE Credit Facility. Our obligations are
secured by substantially all of our assets, excluding our ownership interest in Akorn-Strides, LLC
and in certain licenses and other property in which assignments are prohibited by confidential
provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the GE Credit Agreement, on January&nbsp;7, 2009, we also entered into a
Mortgage, Security Agreement, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Financing Statement and Fixture
Filing by us, in favor of GE Capital, relating to the real property owned by us located in Decatur,
IL. The Mortgages grant a security interest in the 2 parcels of real property to GE Capital, as
security for the Credit Facility.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on January&nbsp;7, 2009, in connection with the GE Credit Agreement, we entered into a
Subordination Agreement by and among the Kapoor Trust, us and GE Capital, as agent for the Lenders.
Pursuant to the Subordination Agreement, the Kapoor Trust and us have agreed that our debt pursuant
to the Subordinated Promissory Note dated as of July&nbsp;28, 2008, in the principal amount of
$5,000,000 (&#147;Subordinated Debt&#148;) payable to the Kapoor Trust is subordinated to the GE Credit
Facility, except that so long as there is no event of default outstanding under the GE Credit
Agreement, we may repay the Subordinated Debt in full so long as such repayment occurs on or before
July&nbsp;28, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;19, 2009, GE Capital informed us that it was applying a reserve against
availability which effectively restricts our borrowings under the GE Credit Agreement to the
balance outstanding as of February&nbsp;19, 2009, which was $5,523,620. GE Capital advised that it was
applying this reserve due to concerns about financial performance, including our prospective
compliance with the EBITDA covenant in the GE Credit Agreement for the quarter that will end March
31, 2009. The restriction on our GE Credit Agreement has severely limited our working capital and capital
resources. As a result of our lack of liquidity, limited capital resources, continued operating
losses and accumulated debt, we have concluded there is substantial doubt as to our ability to
continue as a going concern. See Item&nbsp;1A. &#147;Risks relating to our Credit Agreement&#148; and &#147;Inadequate
liquidity could materially adversely affect our business operations in the future&#148;.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Subordinated Debt</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, we entered into a $5,000,000 convertible subordinated debt agreement including a
$3,000,000 Tranche A note (&#147;Tranche A Note&#148;) and a $2,000,000 Tranche B note (&#147;Tranche B Note&#148;)
with the Kapoor Trust (collectively, the &#147;Convertible Note Agreement&#148;). Under the terms of the
Convertible Note Agreement, both Tranche A Note and Tranche B Note, which were due December&nbsp;20,
2006, bore interest at prime plus 3% and were issued with detachable warrants (the &#147;Tranche A
Warrants&#148; and the &#147;Tranche B Warrants&#148;) to purchase approximately 1,667,000 shares of common stock.
Interest payments were prohibited under the terms of a subordination arrangement. The convertible
feature of the Convertible Note Agreement, as amended, allowed for conversion of the subordinated
debt plus interest into our common stock, at a price of $2.28 per share of common stock for Tranche
A and $1.80 per share of common stock for Tranche B. We negotiated an early settlement of the
Tranche A Note and the Tranche B Note in March&nbsp;2006. The associated principal and accumulated
interest of approximately $7,298,000 was retired by conversion into 3,540,281 shares of our common
stock on March&nbsp;31, 2006. A debt retirement fee of approximately $391,000 was paid as an inducement
to retire these notes prior to the original maturity date of December&nbsp;20, 2006. The detachable
warrants to purchase 1,667,000 shares of common stock were exercised on a cashless basis on
November&nbsp;15, 2006 and the associated net common stock issuance was 807,168 shares.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;28, 2008, we borrowed the Subordinated Debt from the Kapoor Trust in return for
issuing the trust a Subordinated Promissory Note in the principal amount of $5,000,000. The note
accrues interest at a rate of 15% per year and is due and payable on July&nbsp;28, 2009, subject to the
GE Credit Agreement. The proceeds from this note were used in conjunction with the amended MBL
Distribution Agreement, which resulted in favorable pricing and reduced purchase commitments (see
also Note M &#151; Commitments and Contingencies).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Other Indebtedness</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;1998, the Company entered into a $3,000,000 mortgage agreement with Standard Mortgage
Investors, LLC. The principal balance was payable over 10&nbsp;years, and the final principal/interest
payment was made in the second quarter of 2008 to retire this mortgage. The mortgage note bore a
fixed interest rate of 7.375% and was secured by the real property located in Decatur, Illinois.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B>Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and Warrants</B>

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Exchange Transaction as discussed above, we issued 257,172 shares of
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock. Prior to conversion, the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock accrued dividends at a
rate of 6.0% per annum, which rate was fully cumulative, accrued daily and compounded quarterly.
While the dividends could be paid in cash at our option, such dividends were deferred and added to
the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock balance. We also issued Series&nbsp;A Warrants to purchase 8,572,400 shares
of our common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per share. All Series&nbsp;A Warrants were exercised
as of December&nbsp;31, 2006. Holders of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock had full voting rights, with each
holder entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which its
shares could be converted. All shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock had liquidation rights in
preference over junior securities, including the common stock, and had certain anti-dilution
protections. The Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and unpaid dividends were convertible at any time into a
number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $100 per share plus
any accrued but unpaid dividends on that share by (y) $0.75, as such numbers could be adjusted from
time to time pursuant to the terms of our Restated Articles of Incorporation. Until our
shareholders approved certain provisions regarding the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, which occurred in
July&nbsp;2004, the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock had a mandatory redeemable feature in October&nbsp;2011.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock were to convert to shares of common stock on the
earlier of (i)&nbsp;October&nbsp;8, 2006 and (ii)&nbsp;the date on which the closing price per share of common
stock for at least 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding such date exceeded $4.00 per
share. The closing price per share of the Common Stock as reported on the American Stock Exchange
exceeded $4.00 for 20 consecutive trading days as of the close of the market on January&nbsp;12, 2006.
Consequently, on January&nbsp;13, 2006 all 241,122 of our outstanding shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock
automatically converted into an aggregate of 36,796,755 shares of Common Stock. No shares of Series
A Preferred Stock remain outstanding after this conversion. We received no consideration in
connection with the automatic conversion of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock and Warrants</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On August&nbsp;23, 2004, we issued an aggregate of 141,000 shares of Series&nbsp;B 6.0% Participating
Preferred Stock (&#147;Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock&#148;) at a price of $100 per share, that was convertible
into common stock at a price of $2.70 per share, to certain investors, with warrants to purchase
1,566,667 additional shares of common stock exercisable until August&nbsp;23, 2009, with an exercise
price of $3.50 per share (&#147;the &#147;Series&nbsp;B Warrants&#148;). There were 455,556 Series&nbsp;B Warrants
outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The net proceeds to us after payment of
investment banker fees and expenses and other transaction costs of approximately $1,056,000 were
approximately $13,044,000.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to its conversion, the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock accrued dividends at a rate of 6.0% per
annum, which rate was fully cumulative, accrued daily and compounded quarterly. While the dividends
could be paid in cash at our option, such dividends were deferred and added to the Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Stock balance. Each share of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock, and accrued and unpaid dividends
with respect to each such share, was convertible by the holder thereof at any time into a number of
shares of our common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $100 plus any accrued but
unpaid dividends on such share by (y) $2.70, as such numerator and denominator could be adjusted
from time to time pursuant to the anti-dilution provisions of our Restated Articles of
Incorporation governing the Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock. We had the option of converting all shares of
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock on any date after August&nbsp;23, 2005 as to
which the closing price per share of the common stock for at least 20 consecutive trading days
immediately preceding such date exceeds $5.00 per share. The closing price per share of the common
stock as reported on the American Stock Exchange exceeded $5.00 for 20 consecutive trading days as
of the close of the market on December&nbsp;13, 2006. Consequently, all 66,000 outstanding shares of
Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock immediately and automatically converted into an aggregate of 2,804,800
shares of common stock on December&nbsp;14, 2006. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, no shares of Series&nbsp;B
Preferred Stock remain outstanding. We received no consideration in connection with the automatic
conversion of Series&nbsp;B Preferred Stock.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recognize product sales for our ophthalmic, hospital drugs and injectables, and biologics
and vaccines business segments upon the shipment of goods or upon the delivery of goods, depending
on the sales terms. The contract services segment, which produces products for third party
customers, based upon their specification, at a pre-determined price, also recognizes sales upon
the shipment of goods or upon delivery of the product or service as appropriate. Revenue is
recognized when all of our obligations have been fulfilled and collection of the related receivable
is probable. Provision for estimated doubtful accounts, chargebacks, rebates, discounts and product
returns is made at the time of sale and is analyzed and adjusted, if necessary, at each balance
sheet date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Allowance for Chargebacks and Rebates</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We enter into contractual agreements with certain third parties such as hospitals and
group-purchasing organizations to sell certain products at predetermined prices. The parties have
elected to have these contracts administered through wholesalers that buy the product from us and
subsequently sell it to those third parties. When a wholesaler sells products to one of the third
parties that are subject to a contractual price agreement, the difference between the price paid to
us by the wholesaler and the price under the specific contract is charged back to us by the
wholesaler. We track sales and submitted chargebacks by product number and contract for each
wholesaler. Utilizing this information, we estimate a chargeback percentage for each product. We
reduce gross sales and increase the chargeback allowance by the estimated chargeback amount for
each product sold to a wholesaler. We reduce the chargeback allowance when we process a request for
a chargeback from a wholesaler. Actual chargebacks processed can vary materially from

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">period to period based upon actual sales volume through the wholesalers. However, our
provision for chargebacks is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We obtain certain wholesaler inventory reports to aid in analyzing the reasonableness of the
chargeback allowance that will be paid out in the future. We assess the reasonableness of our
chargeback allowance by applying the product chargeback percentage based on historical activity to
the quantities of inventory on hand per the wholesaler inventory reports and an estimate of
in-transit inventory that is not reported on the wholesaler inventory reports at the end of the
period. In accordance with our accounting policy, our estimate of the percentage amount of
wholesaler inventory that will ultimately be sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual
price agreement is based on a six-quarter trend of such sales through wholesalers. We use this
percentage estimate (95% as of December&nbsp;31, 2008) until historical trends or new information
indicates that a revision should be made. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our actual chargeback
rate experience and new trends are factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions
change. We reviewed and revised the estimated percentage amount of wholesaler inventory that will
ultimately be sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement in the fourth
quarter of 2006 which resulted in a $446,000 increase in the chargeback expense in the fourth
quarter of 2006. We have continued to use this revised estimate of 95% in 2007 and 2008 and intend
to use this estimate on a going forward basis until trends indicate that additional revisions
should be made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, we maintain an allowance for rebates related to fee for service contracts and other
programs with certain customers. Rebate percentages vary by product and by volume purchased by each
eligible customer. We track sales by product number for each eligible customer and then apply the
applicable rebate percentage, using both historical trends and actual experience to estimate our
rebate allowance. We reduce gross sales and increase the rebate allowance by the estimated rebate
amount when we sell our products to our rebate-eligible customers. We reduce the rebate allowance
when we process a customer request for a rebate. At each balance sheet date, we analyze the
allowance for rebates against actual rebates processed and make necessary adjustments as
appropriate. Actual rebates processed can vary materially from period to period. However, our
provision for rebates is fully reserved for at the time when sales revenues are recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recorded allowances reflect our current estimate of the future chargeback and rebate
liability to be paid or credited to our wholesaler and other customers under the various contracts
and programs. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded chargeback and
rebate expense of $31,330,000, $31,971,000, and $26,295,000, respectively. The allowance for
chargebacks and rebates was $9,311,000 and $11,690,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Allowance for Product Returns</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain of our products are sold with the customer having the right to return the product
within specified periods and guidelines for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to
pending expiration dates. Provisions are made at the time of sale based upon tracked historical
experience, by customer in some cases. In evaluating month-end allowance balances, we consider
actual returns to date that are in process, the expected impact of product recalls and the
wholesaler&#146;s inventory information to assess the magnitude of unconsumed product that may result in
a product return to us in the future. We had previously estimated our sales returns reserve based
on a historical percentage of returns to sales utilizing a twelve month look back period. In 2008,
we performed a specific detailed review of returns by product/lot and determined the lag time
between product sale and return was longer than we had previously estimated. The gross impact of
this adjustment was $761,000 which was partially offset by $418,000 in reduced chargeback liability
which specifically relates to this revision in the sales returns reserve estimate. We have
recorded this change in estimate in the fourth quarter of 2008. One-time historical factors or
pending new developments that would impact the expected level of returns are taken into account to
determine the appropriate reserve estimate at each balance sheet date. The sales returns level can
be impacted by factors such as overall market demand and market competition and availability for
substitute products which can increase or decrease the end-user pull through for sales of our
products and ultimately impact the level of sales returns. Actual returns experience and trends are
factored into our estimates each quarter as market conditions change. Actual returns processed can
vary materially from period to period. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we
recorded a net provision for product returns of $3,159,000, $610,000 and $3,861,000, respectively.
The 2008 provision includes the impact of discontinuing our multi-dose Td vaccine product, a recall
associated with a supplier&#146;s syringe in our Cyanide Antidote Kit product, the revision in our lag
estimate, increased sales and unfavorable wholesaler product returns experience. The allowance for
potential product returns was $2,539,000 and $1,153,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007,
respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a net expense/(benefit) for
doubtful accounts of $17,000, $(8,000), and $(150,000), respectively. The favorable experience in
2007 and 2006 was due to recoveries and reduced reserve requirements which exceeded write offs and
reduced previously identified collectibility concerns. The allowance for doubtful accounts was
$22,000 and $5,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had
a total of $1,027,000 of past due gross accounts receivable, of which only $203,000 was over 60
days past due. We perform monthly a detailed analysis of the receivables due from our wholesaler
customers and provide a specific reserve against known uncollectible items for each of the
wholesaler customers. We also include in the allowance for doubtful accounts an amount that we
estimate to be uncollectible for all other customers based on a percentage of the past due
receivables. The percentage reserved increases as the age of the receivables increases.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Allowance for Slow-Moving Inventory</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (average cost method) or market. See Item&nbsp;8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note D &#151; &#147;Inventories&#148;. We maintain an allowance for
slow-moving and obsolete inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net
realizable value (&#147;NRV&#148;). For finished goods inventory, we estimate the amount of inventory that
may not be sold prior to its expiration or is slow moving based upon recent sales activity by unit
and wholesaler inventory information. We also analyzed our raw material and component inventory for
slow moving items. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, we recorded a provision
for inventory obsolescence in cost of sales of $765,000, $1,449,000 and $652,000, respectively. The
allowance for inventory obsolescence/NRV was $1,179,000 and $1,260,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, respectively. The increase in the 2007 provision and reserve was mainly due to an increased
level of ending inventory for certain products that, on average, sell below their carrying value.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products prior to regulatory approval when,
based on management judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and the future
economic benefit is expected to be realized. We assess the regulatory approval process and where
the product stands in relation to that approval process including any known constraints or
impediments to approval. We consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the product
timeline for approval. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we expensed $653,000 related to our
generic oral Vancomycin capsule finished good inventory as the FDA review was extended resulting in
increased uncertainty related to the recoverability of this inventory
based on the limited remaining expiry dating of this inventory.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, we had $864,000 in our ending inventory for raw material related to
our generic oral Vancomycin capsule product. As noted above, we have not yet received FDA
approval, however we believe that FDA approval is probable and we will be able to fully realize the
costs of this raw material inventory upon FDA approval of our generic oral Vancomycin capsule
product.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The product warranty liability primarily relates to a ten year expiration guarantee on DTPA
sold to HHS. We are performing yearly stability studies for this product and, if the annual
stability does not support the ten-year product life, we will replace the product at no charge. Our
supplier, Hameln Pharmaceuticals, will also share one-half of this cost if the product does not
meet the stability requirement. If the ongoing product testing confirms the ten-year stability for
DTPA we will not incur a replacement cost and this reserve will be eliminated with a corresponding
reduction to cost of sales after the ten-year period.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between
financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and net operating loss and other tax
credit carryforwards. These items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in
effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the
deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Intangibles consist primarily of product licensing and other such costs that are capitalized
and amortized on the straight-line method over the lives of the related license periods or the
estimated life of the acquired product, which range from 3&nbsp;years to 18&nbsp;years. Amortization expense
was $1,354,000, $1,504,000 and $1,385,000 for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007, and 2006,
respectively. We regularly assess the impairment of intangibles based on several factors, including
estimated fair market value and anticipated cash flows.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Stock-Based Compensation</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), stock compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award, and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the vesting period. We
have historically used the Black-Scholes model for estimating the fair value of stock options in
providing the pro forma fair value method disclosures pursuant to SFAS No.&nbsp;123 and have decided to
continue using this model under SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R). Determining the assumptions that enter into the
model is highly subjective and requires judgment. We use an expected volatility that is based on
the historical volatility of our stock. The expected life assumption is based on historical
employee exercise patterns and employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest
rate for the expected term of the option is based on the average market rate on U.S. treasury
securities in effect during the quarter in which the options were granted. The dividend yield
reflects historical experience as well as future expectations over the expected term of the option.
Also, under SFAS No.&nbsp;123(R), we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and
revise in subsequent periods, if necessary, if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
After reviewing historical forfeiture information, we revised our estimate from 10% used in 2006
and 2007 to 13% as an estimated forfeiture rate for 2008.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;157, &#147;<I>Fair Value Measurements</I>.&#148; SFAS 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February of 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff position 157-2
which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities which are not
measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning after
November&nbsp;15, 2008. Our carrying values approximate the fair values of our financial assets and
liabilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and the adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements and note disclosures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities&#148; (SFAS 159&#148;), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value, which are currently not required to be measured
at fair value. Under SFAS 159, an entity may, at specified election dates, choose to measure items
at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Entities would be required to report a
cumulative adjustment to retained earnings for unrealized gains and losses at the adoption date,
and to recognize changes in fair value in earnings for any items for which the fair value option
has been elected. SFAS 159 was effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, and it did not impact our financial
statements upon adoption or as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. We did not choose to measure any financial
instruments at fair value as permitted under the statement.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;160, &#147;Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148; (&#147;SFAS 160&#148;). SFAS 160 establishes new standards
for the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and
for the loss of control of partially owned and consolidated subsidiaries. SFAS 160 does not change
the criteria for consolidating a partially owned entity. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively upon
adoption except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied
retrospectively. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141(revised 2007) (&#147;SFAS 141R&#148;), a revision of SFAS
141, &#147;Business Combinations.&#148; SFAS 141R establishes requirements for the recognition and
measurement of acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non-controlling interests. SFAS 141R
also provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008. SFAS 141R will be applied prospectively to
business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the effective date.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No.&nbsp;142-3, <I>Determination of the Useful Life of
Intangible Assets. </I>The FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or
extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS
No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>. The intent of the FSP is to improve the consistency
between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No.&nbsp;142 and the period of
expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No.&nbsp;141 (revised 2007),
<I>Business Combinations, </I>and other U.S. GAAP. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is prohibited. We do not believe that FSP SFAS No.&nbsp;142-2 will have a material impact
on our financial statements.

audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing
audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. An audit also includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Akorn, Inc.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We have audited Akorn, Inc.&#146;s internal control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2008,
based on criteria established in Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework issued by the Committee
of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Akorn, Inc.&#146;s
management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and
for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in
the accompanying Management&#146;s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting
based on our audit.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was
maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and
evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,
and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe
that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">A company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A
company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)
pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
and (3)&nbsp;provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company&#146;s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are
subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In our opinion, Akorn, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet of Akorn, Inc. as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
the related consolidated statements of operations, shareholders&#146; equity and cash flows for the year
then ended and our report dated March&nbsp;29, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon that
included an explanatory paragraph regarding Akorn Inc.&#146;s ability to continue as a going concern.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note A &#151; Business and Basis of Presentation</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Business: </I>Akorn, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Akorn (New Jersey), Inc. (collectively,
the &#147;Company&#148;) manufacture and market diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals in specialty areas
such as ophthalmology, rheumatology, anesthesia and antidotes, among others. Customers, including
physicians, optometrists, wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and other pharmaceutical
companies, are served primarily from three operating facilities in the United States. In September
2004, the Company, along with a venture partner, formed a mutually owned limited liability company,
Akorn-Strides, LLC (the &#147;Joint Venture Company&#148;). See Note P &#151; &#147;Business Alliances.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Basis of Presentation: </I>The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern
basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. As more fully disclosed below<B>, </B>the Company has incurred recurring net
losses and the Company&#146;s borrowings on its revolving credit facility have been restricted by the
lender. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going
concern. Management&#146;s plans in regard to these matters also are described below. The accompanying
consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future
effect on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of
liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company&#146;s lack of liquidity, limited capital resources, continued losses
and accumulated debt, there is substantial doubt as to the Company&#146;s ability to continue as a going
concern. The Company&#146;s continuation is dependent upon its ability to generate or obtain sufficient
cash to meet its obligations on a timely basis. On February&nbsp;19, 2009, the Company&#146;s lender, GE Capital, restricted the Company&#146;s borrowings under
its revolving line of credit. See Note F &#151; Financing
Arrangements. The Company&#146;s losses since 2001 have totaled
$85,128,000. Based on its operating plan, its existing working capital is not sufficient to meet
the cash requirements to fund its planned operating expenses, capital expenditures, and working
capital requirements through December&nbsp;31, 2009 without additional sources of cash and/or the
deferral, reduction or elimination of significant planned expenditures. The Company is evaluating
alternatives for cost reduction and as well as certain efficiency and cost containment measures to
improve its profitability and cash flow. In addition, the Company is actively seeking additional
financing for its operations. Currently, the Company has no commitments to obtain additional
capital, and there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms
acceptable to the Company, if at all.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note B &#151; Summary of Significant Accounting Policies</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Consolidation: </I>The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Akorn, Inc and its wholly owned subsidiary, Akorn (New Jersey) Inc. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Use of Estimates: </I>The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from
those estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions for the Company relate to the allowance for
doubtful accounts, the allowance for chargebacks, the allowance for rebates, the allowance for
product returns and the reserve for slow-moving and obsolete inventories, the carrying value of
intangible assets and the carrying value of deferred income tax assets.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Revenue Recognition: </I>The Company recognizes product sales for its ophthalmic and hospital
drugs and injectables business segments upon the shipment of goods or upon the delivery of the
product or service as appropriate. Revenue is recognized when all obligations of the Company have
been fulfilled and collection of the related receivable is probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The contract services segment, which produces products for third party customers based upon
their specification and at a pre-determined price, also recognizes sales upon the shipment of goods
or upon delivery of the product or service as appropriate. Revenue is recognized when all
obligations of the Company have been fulfilled and collection of the related receivable is
probable.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provision for estimated doubtful accounts, chargebacks, rebates, discounts and product returns
is made at the time of sale and is analyzed and adjusted, if necessary, at each balance sheet date.

customers. This is a natural circumstance of the pharmaceutical industry and not specific to the
Company and inherently lengthens the collection process. Depending on the product, the end-user
customer, the specific terms of national supply contracts and the particular arrangements with the
Company&#146;s wholesaler customers, certain rebates, chargebacks and other credits are deducted from
the Company&#146;s accounts receivable. The process of claiming these deductions depends on wholesalers
reporting to the Company the amount of deductions that were earned under the respective terms with
end-user customers (which, in turn, depends on which end-user customer with different pricing
arrangements might be entitled to a particular deduction). This process can lead to &#147;partial
payments&#148; against outstanding invoices as the wholesalers take the claimed deductions at the time
of payment.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise noted, the provisions and allowances for the following customer deductions
are reflected in the accompanying financial statements as reductions of revenues and trade accounts
receivable, respectively.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Chargebacks and Rebates: </I>The Company enters into contractual agreements with certain third
parties such as hospitals and group-purchasing organizations to sell certain products at
predetermined prices. The parties have elected to have these contracts administered through
wholesalers that buy the product from the Company and subsequently sell it to these third parties.
When a wholesaler sells products to one of these third parties that are subject to a contractual
price agreement, the difference between the price paid to the Company by the wholesaler and the
price under the specific contract is charged back to the Company by the wholesaler. The Company
tracks sales and submitted chargebacks by product number and contract for each wholesaler.
Utilizing this information, the Company estimates a chargeback percentage for each product. The
Company reduces gross sales and increases the chargeback allowance by the estimated chargeback
amount for each product sold to a wholesaler. The Company reduces the chargeback allowance when it
processes a request for a chargeback from a wholesaler. Actual chargebacks processed by the Company
can vary materially from period to period based upon actual sales volume through the wholesalers.
However, the Company&#146;s provision for chargebacks is fully reserved for at the time when sales
revenues are recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management obtains certain wholesaler inventory reports to aid in analyzing the reasonableness
of the chargeback allowance. The Company assesses the reasonableness of its chargeback allowance by
applying the product chargeback percentage based on historical activity to the quantities of
inventory on hand per the wholesaler inventory reports and an estimate of in-transit inventory that
is not reported on the wholesaler inventory reports at the end of the period. In accordance with
its accounting policy, the Company&#146;s estimate of the percentage amount of wholesaler inventory that
will ultimately be sold to a third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement is based
on a six-quarter trend of such sales through wholesalers. The Company uses this percentage estimate
(95% as of December&nbsp;31, 2008) until historical trends indicate that a revision should be made. On
an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its actual chargeback rate experience and new trends are
factored into its estimates each quarter as market conditions change. The Company reviewed and
revised the estimated percentage amount of wholesaler inventory that will ultimately be sold to a
third party that is subject to a contractual price agreement in the fourth quarter of 2006 which
resulted in a $446,000 increase in the chargeback expense in the fourth quarter of 2006. The
Company has used this revised estimate of 95% in 2007 and 2008 and intends to use this estimate on
a going forward basis until trends indicate that additional revisions should be made.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, the Company maintains an allowance for rebates related to contract and other
programs with certain customers. Rebate percentages vary by product and by volume purchased by each
eligible customer. The Company tracks sales by product number for each eligible customer and then
applies the applicable rebate percentage, using both historical trends and actual experience to
estimate its rebate allowance. The Company reduces gross sales and increases the rebate allowance
by the estimated rebate amount when the Company sells its products to its rebate-eligible
customers. The Company reduces the rebate allowance when it processes a customer request for a
rebate. At each balance sheet date, the Company analyzes the allowance for rebates against actual
rebates processed and makes necessary adjustments as appropriate. Actual rebates processed can vary
materially from period to period. However, the Company&#146;s provision for rebates is fully reserved
for at the time when sales revenues are recognized.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recorded allowances reflect the Company&#146;s current estimate of the future chargeback and
rebate liability to be paid or credited to its wholesaler and other customers under the various
contracts and programs. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, the Company recorded
chargeback and rebate expense of $31,330,000, $31,971,000 and $26,295,000, respectively. The
allowance for chargebacks and rebates was $9,311,000 and $11,690,000 as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and
2007, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Sales Returns: </I>Certain of the Company&#146;s products are sold with the customer having the right
to return the product within specified periods and guidelines for a variety of reasons, including
but not limited to, pending expiration dates. Provisions are made at the time of sale based upon
tracked historical experience, by customer in some cases. The Company had previously estimated its
sales returns reserve based on a historical percentage of returns to sales utilizing a twelve month
look back period. In 2008, the Company performed a specific detailed review of returns by
product/lot and determined the lag time between product sale and return was longer than it had
previously estimated. The gross impact of this adjustment was $761,000 which was partially offset
by $418,000 in reduced chargeback liability which specifically relates to this revision in the
sales returns reserve estimate. The Company has recorded this change in estimate in the fourth
quarter of 2008. One-time historical factors or pending new developments that would impact the
expected level of returns are taken into account to determine the appropriate reserve estimate at
each balance sheet date. As part of the evaluation of the balance required, the Company considers
actual returns to date that are in process, the expected impact of any product recalls and the
wholesaler&#146;s inventory information to assess the magnitude of unconsumed product that may result in
a sales return to the Company in the future. The sales returns level can be impacted by factors
such as overall market demand and market competition and availability for substitute products which
can increase or decrease the end-user pull through for sales of the Company&#146;s products and
ultimately impact the level of sales returns. Actual returns experience and trends are factored
into the Company&#146;s estimates each quarter as market conditions change. Actual returns processed can
vary materially from period to period. For the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 the
Company recorded a net provision for product returns of $3,159,000, $610,000 and $3,861,000,
respectively. The 2008 provision includes the impact of discontinuing the Company&#146;s multi-dose Td
vaccine product ($524,000), a recall associated with a supplier&#146;s syringe in the Company&#146;s Cyanide
Antidote Kit product ($440,000), the revision in its lag estimate, increased sales and unfavorable
wholesaler product returns experience. The allowance for potential product returns was $2,539,000
and $1,153,000 at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

expense/(benefit) for doubtful accounts of $17,000, $(8,000), and $(150,000), respectively. The
2008 expense was mainly due to one uncollectible account while the favorable experience in 2007 and
2006 was due to recoveries and reduced reserve requirements which exceeded write offs and reduced
previously identified collectibility concerns. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $22,000 and
$5,000, as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company had a
total of $1,027,000 of past due gross accounts receivable, of which $203,000 was over 60&nbsp;days past
due. The Company performs monthly a detailed analysis of the receivables due from its wholesaler
customers and provides a specific reserve against known uncollectible items for each of the
wholesaler customers. The Company also includes in the allowance for doubtful accounts an amount
that it estimates to be uncollectible for all other customers based on a percentage of the past due
receivables. The percentage reserved increases as the age of the receivables increases.

approval when, based on management judgment, future commercialization is considered probable and
the future economic benefit is expected to be realized. The Company assesses the regulatory
approval process and where the product stands in relation to that approval process including any
known constraints or impediments to approval. The Company considers the shelf life of the product

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2008, the Company placed $5,443,000 of construction in progress, which was
specific to lyophilization (freeze-dry) operations, into service. There can be no assurance the
Company will realize the anticipated benefits from its investment into lyophilization capability
and, if not, material impairment charges may be required.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2008, the Company spent $2,263,000 for facility build-out and furniture/equipment along
with lessor-paid build-out costs of $1,768,000 for its new leased warehouse facilities in Gurnee,
Illinois and office space in Lake Forest, Illinois. In conjunction with the move of the
warehousing and office space from its former Buffalo Grove, Illinois facility, the Company removed
assets for leasehold improvements, fixtures, and furniture/equipment that had a net book value of
$49,000 (gross cost $2,099,000, accumulated depreciation of $2,050,000). Certain items were sold
and yielded gross proceeds of $74,000 and the Company recorded a gain of $25,000 as Other Income.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In June&nbsp;1998, the Company entered into a $3,000,000 mortgage agreement with Standard Mortgage
Investors, LLC. The principal balance was payable over 10&nbsp;years, and the final principal/interest
payment was made in the second quarter of 2008 to retire this mortgage. The mortgage note bore a
fixed interest rate of 7.375% and was secured by the real property located in Decatur, Illinois.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;7, 2003, a group of investors (the &#147;Investors&#148;) purchased all of the Company&#146;s then
outstanding senior bank debt from The Northern Trust Company, a balance of $37,731,000, at a
discount and exchanged such debt with the Company (the &#147;Exchange Transaction&#148;) for (i)&nbsp;257,172
shares of Series&nbsp;A 6.0% Participating Convertible Preferred Stock (&#147;Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock&#148;) (see
Note G &#151; &#147;Preferred Stock and Common Stock&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;subordinated promissory notes in the aggregate
principal amount of $2,767,139 (the &#147;2003 Subordinated Notes&#148;), (iii)&nbsp;warrants to purchase an
aggregate of 8,572,400 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per
share (&#147;Series&nbsp;A Warrants&#148;), and (iv) $5,473,862 in cash. On March&nbsp;20, 2006 the Company retired the
2003 Subordinated Notes with a cash payment of $3,288,000 which included the original $2,767,000
principal balance plus the accrued interest up to the date of payment. The Company also issued to
the holders of the 2003 Subordinated Notes warrants to purchase an aggregate of 276,714 shares of
common stock with an exercise price of $1.10 per share. All outstanding warrants as described above
were exercised prior to their October&nbsp;7, 2006 expiration date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simultaneously with the consummation of the Exchange Transaction, the Company entered into a
credit agreement with Bank of America National Association (&#147;Bank of America&#148;) providing the
Company with a revolving line of credit (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;) secured by substantially all of the
assets of the Company. The Credit Facility contained certain restrictive covenants including but
not limited to certain financial covenants such as minimum EBITDA and certain other ratios. Because
the Credit Facility also required the Company to maintain its deposit accounts with Bank of
America, the existence of these subjective covenants, pursuant to EITF Abstract No.&nbsp;95-22, required
that the Company classify outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility as a current liability.
The Credit Facility had a weighted average interest rate of 5.84% during 2008. There was a $0
balance on the Credit Facility at December&nbsp;31, 2008 and a $4,521,000 balance at December&nbsp;31, 2007.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;2, 2007, an Amendment to Credit Agreement with Bank of America was made effective
which, among other things, increased the revolving commitment amount from $10,000,000 to
$15,000,000 under the Credit Facility, required a $1,250,000 restricted cash balance, and amended
certain covenants of the parties set forth in the Credit Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March&nbsp;10, 2008, the Company entered into an Amendment to Credit Agreement with Bank of
America (the &#147;Amendment&#148;). Among other things, the Amendment adjusted the definition of EBITDA,
set minimum EBITDA requirements, increased the restricted cash requirement to $3,300,000 from the
prior $1,250,000 requirement, and amended certain covenants of the parties set forth in the Credit
Facility. The Amendment also extended the Termination Date of the Credit Agreement to January&nbsp;1,
2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company expensed certain previously capitalized product related filing and license fees in
the first quarter of 2008 totaling $1,246,000. As a result, the Company was not in compliance with
its Credit Facility covenants and the Company requested and received an amendment from Bank of
America dated May&nbsp;9, 2008 which adjusted the EBITDA covenant calculation to exclude these
additional research and development expense items. The Company repaid its revolving line of credit
with Bank of America at the end of December&nbsp;2008. The Credit Facility expired on January&nbsp;1, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;7, 2009, the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the &#147;GE Credit Agreement&#148;)
with General Electric Capital Corporation (&#147;GE Capital&#148;) as agent for several financial
institutions (the &#147;Lenders&#148;). Pursuant to the GE Credit Agreement, among other things, the Lenders
have agreed to extend loans to the Company under a revolving credit facility (including a letter of
credit subfacility) up to an aggregate principal amount of $25,000,000 (the &#147;GE Credit Facility&#148;).
At the Company&#146;s election, borrowings under the GE Credit Facility bears interest at a rate equal
to either: (i)&nbsp;the Base Rate (defined as the highest of the Wall Street Journal prime rate, the
federal funds rate plus 0.5% or LIBOR plus 1.0%), plus a margin equal to (x)&nbsp;4% for the period
commencing on the closing date through April&nbsp;14, 2009, or (y)&nbsp;a percentage that ranges between
3.75% and 4.25% for the period after April&nbsp;14, 2009, or (ii)&nbsp;LIBOR (or 2.75%, if LIBOR is less than
2.75%), plus a margin equal to (x)&nbsp;5% for the period commencing on the closing date through April
14, 2009, or (y)&nbsp;a percentage that ranges between 4.75% and 5.25% for the period after April&nbsp;14,
2009. Upon the occurrence of any event of default, the Company shall pay interest equal to an
additional 2.0% per annum. The GE Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial
covenants customary for financings of this type. The negative covenants include, without
limitation, restrictions on liens, indebtedness, payments of dividends, disposition of assets,
fundamental changes, loans and investments, transactions with affiliates and negative pledges. The
financial covenants include fixed charge coverage ratio, minimum-EBITDA, minimum liquidity and a
maximum level of capital expenditures. In addition, the Company&#146;s obligations under the GE Credit
Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default under the GE Credit
Agreement, which includes customary events of default including, without limitation, payment
defaults, defaults in the performance of affirmative and negative covenants, the inaccuracy of
representations or warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency related defaults, defaults relating to
judgments, defaults relating to certain governmental enforcement actions, and a change of control
default.  The
GE Credit Facility shall terminate, and all amounts outstanding thereunder shall be due and
payable, on January&nbsp;7, 2013, or on an earlier date as specified in the GE Credit Agreement. In
2008, the Company capitalized $272,000 of loan origination fees and costs in association with the
GE Credit Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on January&nbsp;7, 2009, in connection with the GE Credit Agreement, the Company entered into
a Guaranty and Security Agreement (the &#147;Guaranty and Security Agreement&#148;) by and among the Company,
GE Capital, as agent for the Lenders and each other secured party thereunder. Pursuant to the
Guaranty and Security Agreement, the Company has granted a security interest to GE Capital in the
collateral described in the Guaranty and Security Agreement as security for the GE Credit Facility.
The Company&#146;s obligations are secured by substantially all of its assets, excluding its ownership
interest in Akorn-Strides, LLC and in certain licenses and other property in which assignments are
prohibited by confidential provisions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the GE Credit Agreement, on January&nbsp;7, 2009, the Company also entered into
a Mortgage, Security Agreement, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Financing Statement and Fixture
Filing by the Company, in favor of GE Capital, relating to the real property owned by the Company
located in Decatur, IL. The Mortgages grant a security interest in the 2 parcels of real property
to GE Capital, as security for the GE Credit Facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also on January&nbsp;7, 2009, in connection with the GE Credit Agreement, the Company entered into
a Subordination Agreement by and among The John N. Kapoor Trust dated September&nbsp;20, 1989 (the
&#147;Kapoor Trust&#148;), the Company and GE Capital, as agent for the Lenders. Pursuant to the
Subordination Agreement, the Kapoor Trust and the Company have agreed that its debt pursuant to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On February&nbsp;19, 2009, GE Capital informed the Company that it was applying a reserve against
availability which effectively restricts the Company&#146;s borrowings under the GE Credit Agreement to
the balance outstanding as of February&nbsp;19, 2009, which was $5,523,620. GE Capital advised that it
was applying this reserve due to concerns about financial performance, including the Company&#146;s
prospective compliance with the EBITDA covenant in the GE Credit Agreement for the quarter that
will end March&nbsp;31, 2009.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Company&#146;s lack of liquidity, limited capital resources, continued operating
losses and accumulated debt, there is substantial doubt as to the Company&#146;s ability to continue as
a going concern (see Note A above).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On July&nbsp;28, 2008, the Company borrowed the Subordinated Debt from the Kapoor Trust, the sole
trustee and sole beneficiary of which is Dr.&nbsp;John N. Kapoor, the Company&#146;s Chairman of the Board of
Directors and the holder of a significant stock position in the Company, in return for issuing the
trust a Subordinated Promissory Note in the principal amount of $5,000,000. The note accrues
interest at a rate of 15% per year and is due and payable on July&nbsp;28, 2009 subject to the GE Credit
Agreement. The proceeds from this note were used in conjunction with the amended MBL Distribution
Agreement that was negotiated with the Massachusetts Biologic Laboratories of the University of
Massachusetts Medical School (&#147;MBL&#148;), which resulted in favorable pricing and reduced purchase
commitments for the Company (see also Note M &#151; Commitments and Contingencies).

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2001, the Company entered into a $5,000,000 convertible subordinated debt agreement (the
&#147;Convertible Note Agreement&#148;) consisting of a $3,000,000 Tranche A note (&#147;Tranche A Note&#148;) and a
$2,000,000 Tranche B note (&#147;Tranche B Note&#148;) with the Kapoor Trust. Borrowings under the
Convertible Note Agreement were due December&nbsp;20, 2006, bore interest at prime plus 3.0% and were
issued with detachable warrants to purchase approximately 1,667,000 shares of common stock.
Interest could not be paid under the Convertible Note Agreement until the termination of the Credit
Facility. The convertible feature of the convertible subordinated debt, as amended, allowed the
Kapoor Trust to immediately convert the subordinated debt plus interest into common stock of the
Company, at a price of $2.28 per share of common stock for Tranche A Note and $1.80 per share of
common stock for Tranche B Note. The Company negotiated an early settlement of the Tranche A Note
and the Tranche B Note in March&nbsp;2006. The associated principal and accumulated interest of
approximately $7,298,000 was retired by conversion into 3,540,281 shares of the Company&#146;s common
stock on March&nbsp;31, 2006. A debt retirement fee of approximately $391,000 was paid as an inducement
to retire these notes prior to the original maturity date of December&nbsp;20, 2006. The detachable
warrants to purchase 1,667,000 shares of common stock were exercised on a cashless basis on
November&nbsp;15, 2006 and the associated net common stock issuance was 807,168 shares.

the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock accrued dividends at a rate of 6.0% per annum, which rate was fully
cumulative, accrued daily and compounded quarterly. While the dividends could be paid in cash at
the Company&#146;s option, such dividends were deferred and added to the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock
balance. The Company also issued Series&nbsp;A Warrants to purchase 8,572,400 shares of the Company&#146;s
common stock with an exercise price of $1.00 per share. All Series&nbsp;A Warrants were exercised as of
December&nbsp;31, 2006. Holders of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock had full voting rights, with each holder
entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which its shares
could be converted. All shares of Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock had liquidation rights in preference
over junior securities, including the common stock, and had certain anti-dilution protections. The
Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock and unpaid dividends were convertible at any time into a number of shares
of common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) $100 per share plus any accrued but
unpaid dividends on that share by (y) $0.75, as such numbers could be adjusted from time to time
pursuant to the terms of the Company&#146;s Restated Articles of Incorporation. Until the Company&#146;s
shareholders approved certain provisions regarding the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock, which occurred in
July&nbsp;2004, the Series&nbsp;A Preferred Stock had a mandatory redeemable feature in October&nbsp;2011.

2, 2003, officers and employees of the Company were eligible to receive options as designated by
the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. The Akorn, Inc. 2003 Stock Option Plan (&#147;2003 Stock Option
Plan&#148;), which replaced the Incentive Program, was approved by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors on
November&nbsp;6, 2003 and approved by its stockholders on July&nbsp;8, 2004. Under the 2003 Stock Option
Plan, 2,519,000 options have been granted and 611,000 remain outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
On March&nbsp;29, 2005, the Company&#146;s Board of Directors approved the Amended and Restated Akorn, Inc.
2003 Stock Option Plan (the &#147;Amended 2003 Plan&#148;), effective as of April&nbsp;1, 2005, and this was
subsequently approved by its stockholders on May&nbsp;27, 2005. The Amended 2003 Plan is an amendment
and restatement of the 2003 Stock Option Plan and provides the Company with the ability to grant
other types of equity awards to eligible participants besides stock options. Commencing May&nbsp;27,
2005, all new awards have been granted under the Amended 2003 Plan. The aggregate number of shares
of the Company&#146;s common stock that may be issued pursuant to awards granted under the Amended 2003
Plan is 5,000,000. Under the Amended 2003 Plan, 3,593,000 options have been granted to employees
and directors and 3,073,000 remain outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. Options granted under the
Incentive Program, the 2003 Stock Option Plan, and the Amended 2003 Plan have exercise prices
equivalent to the market value of the Company&#146;s common stock on the date of grant and generally
vest over a period of three years and expire within a period of five years.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
123 (revised 2004), &#147;Share Based Payment&#148; (SFAS 123(R)), applying the modified prospective method.
Prior to the adoption of SFAS 123(R), the Company applied the provisions of APB Opinion No.&nbsp;25,
&#147;Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,&#148; in accounting for its stock-based awards, and
accordingly, recognized no compensation cost for its stock plans other than for its restricted
stock awards.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the modified prospective method, SFAS 123(R) applies to new awards and to awards that
were outstanding as of December&nbsp;31, 2005 that are subsequently vested, modified, repurchased or
cancelled. Compensation expense recognized during 2008, 2007, and 2006 includes the portion vesting
during the period for (1)&nbsp;all share-based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of
December&nbsp;31, 2005, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.&nbsp;123, &#147;Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation&#148; (SFAS 123) and (2)&nbsp;all share-based payments granted subsequent to December&nbsp;31, 2005,
based on the grant-date fair value estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The
Company has calculated its available APIC pool of net excess benefits using the alternative

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stock option compensation expense of $1,685,000, $2,595,000 and $1,229,000 was recognized
during the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. For awards issued prior to
January&nbsp;1, 2006, the Company used the multiple award method for allocating the compensation cost to
each period. For awards issued on or after January&nbsp;1, 2006, concurrent with the adoption of SFAS
123(R), the Company has elected to use the single-award method for allocating the compensation cost
to each period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under SFAS 123(R) the fair value of stock options granted is determined using the
Black-Scholes model. The Company&#146;s expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of
its stock. The expected life assumption is based on historical employee exercise patterns and
employee post-vesting termination behavior. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of
the option is based on the average market rate on U.S. treasury securities in effect during the
quarter in which the options were granted. The dividend yield reflects historical experience as
well as future expectations over the expected term of the option. Also, SFAS 123(R) requires an
estimate of forfeitures at the time of grant and revision in subsequent periods, if necessary, if
actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. After reviewing historical forfeiture information,
the Company decided to revise its estimated forfeiture rate from 10% used in 2006 and 2007 to 13%
as an estimated forfeiture rate for 2008. The assumptions used in estimating the fair value of the
stock options granted during the period, along with the weighted-average grant date fair values,
were as follows:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred income tax assets to the
amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In performing its analysis of whether a
valuation allowance to reduce the deferred income tax asset was necessary, the Company evaluated
the data and determined the amount of the net deferred income tax assets that are more likely than
not to be realized. Based upon its analysis, the Company established a valuation allowance to
reduce the net deferred income tax assets to zero. The Company has net operating loss carry
forwards of approximately $67&nbsp;million expiring from 2021 through 2028.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On January&nbsp;1, 2007, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
Interpretation (FIN)&nbsp;No.&nbsp;48, &#147;Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes &#151; an Interpretation of
FASB Statement No.&nbsp;109&#148; (FIN No.&nbsp;48), which prescribes a two-step process for the financial
statement measurement and recognition of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax
return. The first step involves the determination of whether it is more likely than not (greater
than 50% likelihood) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical
merits of the position. The second step requires that any tax position that meets the more likely
than not recognition threshold be measured and recognized in the financial statements at the
largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. FIN No.&nbsp;48 also provides guidance on the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note L &#151; Segment Information</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;31, 2006 and for the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
2007, the Company had three reporting segments. The Company&#146;s reportable segments are based upon
internal financial reports that disaggregate certain operating information. The Company&#146;s chief
operating decision maker, as defined in SFAS No.&nbsp;131, is its chief executive officer, or CEO.
Effective March 29, 2009, the Company&#146;s Chief Financial Officer
(&#147;CFO&#148;) was appointed its interim CEO, and as such,
oversees operational assessments and
resource allocations based upon the results of the Company&#146;s reportable segments, all of which have
available discrete financial information. In September&nbsp;2007, the Company introduced its adult
Tetanus-Diphtheria (&#147;Td&#148;) vaccine. This product, as well as other similar products the Company
introduced since and plans to introduce, will be evaluated separately from its other reportable
segments. As such, the Company created a new reportable segment called biologics and vaccines as
of the fourth quarter of 2007. Accordingly, the Company has modified its method of operating and
evaluating its business units and, as a result, the Company modified its business reporting from
three identifiable reporting segments to four segments in accordance with SFAS 131. This had no
impact on prior year segment classifications.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company classifies its operations into four business segments, ophthalmic, hospital drugs
and injectables, biologics and vaccines, and contract services. The ophthalmic segment
manufactures, markets and distributes diagnostic and therapeutic pharmaceuticals. The hospital
drugs and injectables segment manufactures, markets and distributes drugs and injectable
pharmaceuticals, primarily in niche markets. This segment was previously classified as the
injectable segment, however the Company recently changed the classification to reflect that an
increasing amount of pharmaceuticals delivered by the Company to hospitals are drugs other than
injectable pharmaceuticals. The new classification reflects that the segment includes both drugs
and injectable pharmaceuticals. The biologics &#038; vaccines segment (a new business segment launched
in September&nbsp;2007) markets adult Td vaccines directly to hospitals and physicians as well as
through wholesalers and national distributors. The contract services segment manufactures products
for third party pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers based on their specifications. The
Company&#146;s basis of accounting in preparing its segment information is consistent with that used in
preparing its consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company manages its business segments to the gross profit level and manages its operating
and other costs on a company-wide basis. Intersegment activity at the gross profit level is
minimal. The Company does not identify assets by segment for internal purposes, as certain
manufacturing and warehouse facilities support more than one segment.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;On March&nbsp;29, 2007, the Company received a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (&#147;FDA&#148;)
Warning Letter (the &#147;Warning Letter&#148;) following a routine inspection of its Decatur, Illinois
manufacturing facility conducted from September&nbsp;12 through September&nbsp;29, 2006. The Warning Letter
alleged violations of the current Good Manufacturing Practice (&#147;cGMP&#148;) regulations. The Warning
Letter stated that failure to promptly correct the cited violations may result in legal action
without further notice, including, without limitation, seizure and injunction. It also stated that
approval of pending new drug applications may be withheld until the violations are corrected and
that a subsequent confirmatory FDA inspection may be made. The Company responded to the Warning
Letter on April&nbsp;19, 2007 providing clarifying information and describing corrective actions planned
and/or completed. The Warning Letter had no impact on FDA approved products manufactured or
distributed by the Company&#146;s Decatur facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FDA conducted another inspection of the Decatur facility from July&nbsp;23, 2007 to August&nbsp;17, 2007.
The FDA investigators identified a number of observations representing potential violations of the
cGMP regulations. The Company submitted comprehensive responses to these observations on September
28, 2007. Subsequently, the Company was notified by the FDA on December&nbsp;20, 2007, all cGMP issues
had been satisfactorily resolved resulting in removal of the Warning Letter&#146;s potential
restrictions on new product approvals; approval of the lyophilization and filling operations of the
Decatur facility; and approval of the site transfer for manufacture of IC Green to the Decatur
facility. Since then, the Company has received FDA approval of several Abbreviated New Drug
Applications (&#147;ANDAs&#148;) and New Drug Applications (&#147;NDAs&#148;) for manufacture of product at the Decatur
facility.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;On October&nbsp;8, 2003, the Company, pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement dated
September&nbsp;26, 2002 between the Company and AEG Partners LLC (&#147;AEG&#148;), terminated AEG. On August 2
and 3, 2004, the Company and AEG participated in a mandatory and binding arbitration hearing. The
arbitrator took the matter under submission and rendered his decision dated August&nbsp;19, 2004, which
was received on August&nbsp;23, 2004. The arbitrator&#146;s decision directed the following: (1)&nbsp;payment to
AEG for the sum of $300,000, plus interest of 5% per annum from October&nbsp;7, 2003 (approximately
$13,479), (2)&nbsp;issuance of warrants to AEG to purchase 1,250,000 shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $0.75 per share, and (3)&nbsp;denial of AEG&#146;s request that the Company pay AEG&#146;s
attorneys&#146; fees and costs. As a result of the arbitrator&#146;s decision, the Company reported a
one-time net gain of approximately $295,000 in the third quarter of 2004. It was determined none of
the anti-dilution provisions in our outstanding securities were triggered by the issuance of the
AEG Warrants. All AEG warrants were exercised as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;The Company has an outstanding product warranty reserve which relates to a ten year
expiration guarantee on DTPA sold to HHS in 2006. The Company is performing yearly stability
studies for this product and, if the annual stability does not support the ten-year product life,
it will replace the product at no charge. The Company&#146;s supplier, Hameln Pharmaceuticals, will also
share one-half of this cost if the product does not meet the stability requirement. If the ongoing
product testing confirms the ten-year stability for DTPA, the Company will not incur a replacement
cost and this reserve will be eliminated with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales after the
ten-year period.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iv)&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2008, the Company and MBL amended their Exclusive Distribution Agreement dated as
of March&nbsp;22, 2007 (the &#147;MBL Distribution Agreement&#148;) to: (i)&nbsp;allow the Company to destroy its
remaining inventory of Td vaccine, 15 dose/vial, in exchange for receiving an equivalent number of
doses of preservative-free Td vaccine, 1 dose/vial (the &#147;Single-dose Product&#148;) at no additional
cost other than destruction and documentation expenses; (ii)&nbsp;reduce the aggregate purchase price of
the Single-dose Product during the first year of the MBL Distribution Agreement by approximately
14.4%; (iii)&nbsp;reduce the Company&#146;s purchase commitment for the second year of the MBL Distribution
Agreement by approximately 34.7%; and (iv)&nbsp;reduce the Company&#146;s purchase commitment for the third
year of the MBL Distribution Agreement by approximately 39.5%.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company was unable to make a payment of approximately $3,375,000 for Td vaccine products
which was due to its strategic partner, MBL, by February&nbsp;27, 2009 under its MBL Distribution
Agreement. While the Company made a partial payment of $1,000,000 to MBL on March&nbsp;13, 2009, it would have also been
unable to make another payment of approximately $3,375,000 due to MBL on March&nbsp;28, 2009.
Accordingly, the company entered into a letter agreement with MBL on March&nbsp;27, 2009 (&#147;MBL Letter
Agreement&#148;), pursuant to which it agreed to pay MBL the $5,750,000 remaining due for these Td
vaccine products plus an additional $4,750,000 in consideration of the amendments to the MBL
Distribution Agreement payable according to a periodic payment schedule through June&nbsp;30, 2010. In
addition, pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement, the MBL Distribution Agreement was converted to a
non-exclusive

12, 2009 to secure its obligation to pay amounts due to MBL, and the Company will be released from
its obligation to further purchase Td vaccine products from MBL upon providing MBL with such letter
of credit. In addition, pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement, MBL agreed not to declare a breach
or otherwise act to terminate the MBL Distribution Agreement provided that the Company complies
with the terms of the MBL Letter Agreement, the MBL Distribution Agreement (as amended by the MBL
Letter Agreement) and any agreements required to be entered into pursuant to the MBL Letter
Agreement.
The Company anticipates that Dr. John Kapoor, the Chairman of the Company&#146;s board of directors and one of
its principal shareholders, will provide the standby letter of credit to MBL pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement.
If for any reason the Company is unable to provide the standby letter of credit to MBL by April 12, 2009
or if the Company is unable to make any payment under the MBL
Letter Agreement when due and MBL is unable to draw on the standby letter of credit, the Company
would be in breach of the MBL Letter Agreement.  The Company expects that Dr. Kapoor will be compensated in an amount
to be determined for providing the standby letter of credit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(vii)&nbsp;The Company has entered into strategic business agreements for the development and
marketing of finished dosage form pharmaceutical products with various pharmaceutical development
companies.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each strategic business agreement includes a future payment schedule for contingent milestone
payments and in certain strategic business agreements, minimum royalty payments. The Company will
be responsible for contingent milestone payments and minimum royalty payments to these strategic
business partners based upon the occurrence of future events. Each strategic business agreement
defines the triggering event of its future payment schedule, such as meeting product development
progress timelines, successful product testing and validation, successful clinical studies, various
FDA and other regulatory approvals and other factors as negotiated in each agreement. None of the
contingent milestone payments or minimum royalty payments is individually material to the Company.
These costs, when realized, will be reported as part of research and development expense or as a
component of cost of sales in the Company&#146;s Consolidated Statement of Operations.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table below summarizes contingent potential milestone payments and minimum royalty
payments to strategic partners for the years 2009 and beyond assuming all such contingencies occur

Przybyl ceased to be President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company on January 29, 2009.  Mr. Przybyl's Executive Employment Agreement dated April 24, 2006, which was filed with the SEC as Exhibit 10.1 to Akorn, Inc.'s report on Form 8-K filed April 28, 2006, requires the Company to pay severance under the circumstances specified in the Executive Employment Agreement.  The Company
has not resolved severance issues with Mr. Przybyl as of the date of this filing and therefore any potential amounts due under this agreement cannot be reasonably estimated.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;157, &#147;<I>Fair Value Measurements</I>.&#148; SFAS 157 defines
fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair
value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. In February of 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff position 157-2
which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non-financial assets and liabilities which are not
measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually) until fiscal years beginning after
November&nbsp;15, 2008. The Company&#146;s carrying values approximate the fair values of its financial
assets and liabilities as of December&nbsp;31, 2008 and the adoption of SFAS 157 did not have a material
impact on its consolidated financial statements and note disclosures.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, &#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities&#148; (SFAS 159&#148;), which permits entities to choose to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value, which are currently not required to be measured
at fair value. Under SFAS 159, an entity may, at specified election dates, choose to measure items
at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis. Entities would be required to report a
cumulative adjustment to retained earnings for unrealized gains and losses at the adoption date,
and to recognize changes in fair value in earnings for any items for which the fair value option
has been elected. SFAS 159 was effective January&nbsp;1, 2008, and it did not impact the Company&#146;s
financial statements upon adoption or as of December&nbsp;31, 2008. The Company did not choose to
measure any financial instruments at fair value as permitted under the statement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;160, &#147;Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated
Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No.&nbsp;51&#148; (&#147;SFAS 160&#148;). SFAS 160 establishes new standards
for the accounting for and reporting of non-controlling interests (formerly minority interests) and
for the loss of control of partially owned and consolidated subsidiaries. SFAS 160 does not change
the criteria for consolidating a partially owned entity. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years
beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008. The provisions of SFAS 160 will be applied prospectively upon
adoption except for the presentation and disclosure requirements which will be applied
retrospectively. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact
on its consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In December&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;141(revised 2007) (&#147;SFAS 141R&#148;), a revision of SFAS
141, &#147;Business Combinations.&#148; SFAS 141R establishes requirements for the recognition and
measurement of acquired assets, liabilities, goodwill, and non-controlling interests. SFAS 141R
also provides disclosure requirements related to business combinations. SFAS 141R is effective for
fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008. SFAS 141R will be applied prospectively to
business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the effective date.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In April&nbsp;2008, the FASB issued FSP SFAS No.&nbsp;142-3, <I>Determination of the Useful Life of
Intangible Assets. </I>The FSP amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or
extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS
No.&nbsp;142, <I>Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets</I>. The intent of the FSP is to improve the consistency
between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No.&nbsp;142 and the period of
expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No.&nbsp;141 (revised 2007),
<I>Business Combinations, </I>and other U.S. GAAP. The FSP is effective for financial statements issued
for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years.
Early adoption is prohibited. The Company does not believe that FSP SFAS No.&nbsp;142-2 will have a
material impact on its financial statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On April&nbsp;21, 2004, the Company announced the signing of a memo of understanding with Strides
Arcolab Limited (&#147;Strides&#148;), a pharmaceutical manufacturer based in India. As a result of
negotiations following the execution of the memo of understanding, on September&nbsp;22, 2004, the
Company entered into agreements with Strides for the development, manufacturing and marketing of
grandfathered products, patent-challenge products and ANDA products for the U.S. hospital and
retail markets. The joint venture operates in the form of a Delaware limited liability company,
Akorn-Strides, LLC (the &#147;Joint Venture Company&#148;). Strides will be responsible for developing,
manufacturing and supplying products under an OEM Agreement between it and the Joint Venture
Company. The Company will be responsible for sales and marketing of the products under an exclusive
Sales and Marketing Agreement with the Joint Venture Company. Strides and Akorn each own 50% of the
Joint Venture Company with equal management representation. The Company is accounting for the Joint
Venture Company earnings/losses on the equity method of accounting in accordance with its 50%
ownership interest.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Joint Venture Company launched its first commercialized product in the third quarter of

included revenue of $2,024,000, gross profit of $1,872,000 and net income of $589,000. The
Company&#146;s 50% share of the Joint Venture Company net income, $295,000, is reflected as equity in
earnings of unconsolidated joint venture on the Company&#146;s statement of operations and statement of
cash flows. There was minimal financial impact associated with the Joint Venture Company
operations in 2007 and 2006.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On November&nbsp;16, 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Hameln, a private German
pharmaceuticals company, to license and supply to the Company two Orphan Drug NDA&#146;s: Calcium-DTPA
and Zinc-DTPA. The two drugs were approved on August&nbsp;11, 2004 by the FDA, and are indicated as
antidotes for the treatment of radioactive poisoning. Sales for the two drugs commenced in the
fourth quarter of 2004. Under the agreement, Hameln provides the Company an exclusive license for
an initial term of five years with automatic successive two-year extensions. The Company paid a
one-time 1,550,000 Euro ($2,095,000) license fee, which is reflected as an intangible asset being
amortized over a seven year period. The Company is responsible for marketing and distributing both
drugs in the U.S. and Canada. The Company pays Hameln the greater of 50% of its gross revenues or a
minimum transfer price for the product. Hameln is responsible for the manufacturing of both drugs
for the Company. The Company is responsible for the payment of any annual FDA establishment fees
and for the cost of any post approval studies.

distributes the Td vaccine products on an exclusive basis in the United States and Puerto Rico.
The Company&#146;s revenues from these Td vaccine products were $38,222,000 and $7,522,000, in 2008 and
2007, respectively.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Note Q &#151; Customer and Supplier Concentration</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008 the Company&#146;s major sales were through three large wholesale drug distributors which
account for a large portion of the Company&#146;s gross sales, revenues and accounts receivable across
all business segments except contract services. AmerisourceBergen Health Corporation
(&#147;Amerisource&#148;), Cardinal Health, Inc. (&#147;Cardinal&#148;) and McKesson Drug Company (&#147;McKesson&#148;) are all
distributors of the Company&#146;s products, as well as suppliers of a broad range of health care
products. The percentage impact that these customers had on the Company&#146;s business as of and for
the years ended as indicated is listed below. In 2006 the Company sold $25,464,000 of its radiation
DTPA antidote products in its hospital drugs and injectables segment to HHS which represented 36%
of its revenues in 2006.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If sales to Amerisource, Cardinal or McKesson were to diminish or cease, the Company believes
that the end users of its products would find little difficulty obtaining the Company&#146;s products
either directly from the Company or from another distributor.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2008 and 2007 purchases from MBL represented 62% and 64% of the Company&#146;s purchases,
respectively, while in 2006 purchases from Hameln represented approximately 13% of the Company&#146;s
purchases. In 2008 and 2007, MBL was the Company&#146;s sole supplier of Td vaccine for its vaccine
segment and in 2006 Hameln was the Company&#146;s sole supplier of DTPA for its hospital drugs &#038;
injectables segment. The Company requires a supply of quality raw materials and components to
manufacture and package pharmaceutical products for its own use and for third parties with which it
has contracted. The principal components of the Company&#146;s products are active and inactive
pharmaceutical ingredients and certain packaging materials. Many of these components are available
from only a single source and, in the case of many of the Company&#146;s ANDAs and NDAs, only one
supplier of raw materials has been identified. Because FDA approval of drugs requires manufacturers
to specify their proposed suppliers of active ingredients and certain packaging materials in their
applications, FDA approval of any new supplier would be required if active ingredients or such
packaging materials were no longer available from the specified supplier. The qualification of a
new supplier could delay the Company&#146;s development and marketing efforts. If for any reason the
Company is unable to obtain sufficient quantities of any of the raw materials or components
required to produce and package its products, it may not be able to manufacture its products as
planned, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company&#146;s business, financial condition
and results of operations.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An evaluation was performed, under the supervision and with the participation of Company
management, including the Chief Executive Officer (&#147;CEO&#148;) and the
Chief Financial Officer (&#147;CFO&#148;), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of
the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(e) under the Exchange
Act). There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and
procedures, including cost limitations, judgments used in decision making, assumptions regarding
the likelihood of future events, soundness of internal controls, fraud, the possibility of human
error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even
effective disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance of achieving their control objectives. Based on that evaluation, management, including
the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of
December&nbsp;31, 2008, the Company&#146;s disclosure controls and procedures were effective in all material
respects at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed in
reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and timely reported in accordance with the rules and forms of the SEC.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Company management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control
over financial reporting; as such term is defined in Rule&nbsp;13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Under
the supervision and with the participation of Company management, including the CEO and the CFO, an evaluation was performed of the effectiveness of
the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting. The evaluation was based on the framework
in &#147;Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework&#148; issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission (&#147;COSO&#148;). There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any
internal control, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of
controls. Accordingly, even effective internal controls over financial reporting can provide only
reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation. Further, because of changes
in conditions, the effectiveness of internal control may vary over time. Based on the evaluation
under the framework in &#147;Internal Control &#151; Integrated Framework&#148; issued by COSO, Company
management concluded that the Company&#146;s internal control over financial reporting was effective at
the reasonable assurance level as of December&nbsp;31, 2008.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">On March 27, 2009 we entered into a letter
agreement (&#147;MBL Letter Agreement&#148;) with the Massachusetts Biological Laboratories of the University of
Massachusetts (&#147;MBL&#148;), which, among other things, amends our Exclusive Distribution Agreement dated March 22,
2007 (the &#147;MBL Distribution Agreement&#148;) with MBL for distribution of Td vaccines.  Pursuant to the MBL Letter
Agreement, we agreed to pay MBL $5,750,000 previously due for Td vaccine products plus an additional
$4,750,000 in consideration of the amendments to the MBL Distribution Agreement. Our payments are payable
according to a periodic payment schedule through June 30, 2010.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">In addition, pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement,
the MBL Distribution Agreement was converted to a non-exclusive agreement, we are obligated to provide MBL
with a standby letter of credit by April 12, 2009 to secure our obligation to pay amounts due to MBL, and we
will be released from our obligation to further purchase Td vaccine products from MBL upon providing MBL with
such letter of credit.   Further, MBL agreed not to declare a breach or otherwise act to terminate the MBL
Distribution Agreement provided that we comply with the terms of the MBL Letter Agreement, the MBL
Distribution Agreement (as amended by the MBL Letter Agreement) and any agreements required to be entered
into pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">We anticipate that Dr. John Kapoor, the Chairman
of our board of directors and one of our principal shareholders, will provide the standby letter of credit to
MBL pursuant to the MBL Letter Agreement.  If for any reason we are unable to provide the standby letter of
credit to MBL by April 12, 2009 or if we are unable to make any payment under the MBL Letter Agreement when
due and MBL is unable to draw on the standby letter of credit, we would be in breach of the MBL Letter
Agreement.  We expect that Dr. Kapoor will be compensated in an amount to be determined for providing the
standby letter of credit.

appointed Jeffrey A. Whitnell, our current Sr. Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and
Treasurer, as our interim Chief Executive Officer.  Mr. Whitnell will also continue to serve as our Sr.
Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Whitnell&#146;s appointment is effective
March 29, 2009.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr. Whitnell, age 53, has served as our Vice
President, Finance and CFO since June 2004.  He was further appointed Secretary and Treasurer in August 2004
and was promoted to Senior Vice President in November 2004.  Before joining us, Mr. Whitnell served as Vice
President of Finance and Treasurer with Ovation Pharmaceuticals, a specialty pharmaceutical company.
Prior to joining Ovation Pharmaceuticals in June 2002, Mr. Whitnell worked for MediChem Life Sciences,
which he joined in April 1997, and where he held various senior financial management positions.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">Mr. Whitnell&#146;s appointment will continue until such
time as a permanent Chief Executive Officer is qualified and appointed and does not alter any other terms of
Mr. Whitnell&#146;s employment, including compensation.
