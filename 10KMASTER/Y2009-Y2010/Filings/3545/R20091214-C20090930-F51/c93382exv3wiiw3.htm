<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%"><U>Number, Election and Duties of Directors; Vacancies in Board.</U> The management of the business and affairs
of the Company shall be vested in a Board of Directors ranging from seven (7)&nbsp;to eleven (11), which shall have all of
the powers possessed by the Company itself, so far as this designation of authority is not inconsistent with the laws
of the state of Florida, the Articles of Incorporation, or some other express provision of these Bylaws. The number of
Directors may be increased or decreased from time to time by amendment of the Bylaws consistent with the limitations
provided in the Articles of Incorporation, but no decrease shall have the effect of shortening the term of any
incumbent director.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">At each annual meeting of the stockholders, the stockholders shall elect Directors to hold office until the next
succeeding annual meeting or until their respective successors shall be elected and qualified. The Board of Directors
shall designate and appoint one of its members as Chairman of the Board, and may but shall not be required to designate
one of its members as Vice Chairman of the Board. The stockholders, at any special meeting, may remove from office any
Director of the Company and may fill the vacancy caused by such removal.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors because of death, resignation, removal, or otherwise, may be
filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining Directors though less than a quorum of the Board of
Directors. Any Director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his/her predecessor in

meeting shall be necessary.

persons entitled to such notice, whether before or after the time of such meeting, and shall be equivalent to the
giving of such notice. Attendance of a Director at such other meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such
meeting, except where a Director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
business, because such meeting is not lawfully convened.


<P align="justify" style="font-size: 10pt; text-indent: 4%">Any action of the Board of Directors which is required or permitted to be taken at a meeting may be taken without
a meeting if written consent to the action signed by all members of the Board is filed in the minutes of the
