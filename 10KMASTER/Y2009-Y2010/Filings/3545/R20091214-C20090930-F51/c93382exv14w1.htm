CORPORATE PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES<BR>
(&#147;Code of Ethics&#148;)
</DIV>


<DIV align="Center" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Preamble
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Alico, Inc. (&#147;Alico&#148; or the &#147;Company&#148;) has always insisted that its employees, officers and
directors maintain the highest level of integrity in their dealings with each other and with
the public on behalf of the Company. This Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (the &#147;Code&#148;) is
intended to document some of the specific principles of conduct and ethics which will be
followed by Alico&#146;s directors, officers and employees in the performance of their
responsibilities with respect to the Company&#146;s business. The purpose of the Code is to:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent
conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Promote full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure to the public, including
Alico&#146;s periodic reports required to be filed with the Securities Exchange Commission;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Promote compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Provide guidance to directors, officers and employees to help them recognize and deal with
ethical issues;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Provide a mechanism to report questionable, dishonest or unethical conduct;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Help foster a culture of honesty, civility and accountability.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Alico&#146;s directors have committed that they will comply at all times with the principles set
forth in this Code and they expect each of Alico&#146;s officers and employees to do likewise. A
violation is grounds for disciplinary action up to and including discharge and possible legal
prosecution.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Article&nbsp;I. Ethical Conduct
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">1. Each director, officer and employee of the Company will at all times deal fairly with
Alico&#146;s customers, suppliers, partners, stockholders and employees, and will conduct business
activities and operations in an ethical manner and in compliance with all applicable laws,
rules, regulations and Company policies and with the standards set forth in this Code.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">2. Each director, officer and employee will:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Avoid all conflicts of interest between his/her personal and professional relationships;
provided, however, that if any person or entity suggests some activity, transaction,
relationship, or that such person or entity enter into a business situation that places or
appears to place any director, officer or employee in a conflict of interest situation, such
conflict or potential conflict must be immediately and fully disclosed to the Company&#146;s Board
of Directors and/or the Company&#146;s Audit Committee prior to any commitment by the Company with
respect thereto and the conflict should be dealt with in accordance with our Board&#146;s procedures
for handling disclosed potential conflicts as set forth in Article&nbsp;III below;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Provide, or cause to be provided, full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Comply, and take reasonable actions to encourage others within the Company to comply, with
applicable governmental laws, rules and regulations;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Promptly report violations of this Code as required and specified in the Reporting Procedures

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Promote accountability and adherence pursuant to this Code.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">3. Company records must at all times be prepared accurately and maintained properly, in
accordance with Alico records management policies as well as all applicable laws, rules and
regulations. No false, misleading, artificial or deceptive entries may be made in the Company&#146;s
records for any reason. The simple rule of thumb is that the Company&#146;s books must accurately,
fully and fairly reflect the transactions and activities that have occurred.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">4. The Company records belong to the Company. Therefore, the Company records should not be
removed from the Company property except for a legitimate business reason, and any documents so
removed should be returned to the Company as soon as is practical. Accounting procedures,
processes and controls are prescribed by Company policies. Within these policies, the senior
officers of Alico have the primary responsibility for establishing and monitoring adequate
systems of internal accounting and controls in accordance with sound accounting principles. All
employees must adhere to these controls. The Company&#146;s auditors will be asked from time to time
to monitor and report upon these internal controls. Alico employees are required to cooperate
completely, fully and forthrightly with the Company&#146;s internal auditors and accountants,
external independent auditors, and with Alico&#146;s Audit Committee. No employee, officer or
director may engage in, permit, or conceal any financial or bookkeeping irregularity, deceptive
act or attempt to mislead.

laws, rules and regulations.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Alico&#146;s directors, officers and employees who are in possession of material, non-public
information must refrain from (i)&nbsp;buying or selling securities, either personally or on behalf
of others on the basis of such information, (ii)&nbsp;using such information for personal gain and
(iii)&nbsp;disclosing such information to anyone outside the Company who does not require such
information for business purposes in the performance of their services to the Company.
Material, non-public information is factual information that a reasonable investor would want
to know before making an investment decision to buy or sell the Company&#146;s securities and that
has not been disclosed to the public.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Article&nbsp;III. Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest and Board Procedures for Resolution of the
same.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 10pt">Directors, officers and employees have a primary business responsibility to the Company and
must take all reasonable actions necessary to avoid conflicts of interest or the appearance of
conflicts of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when an individual&#146;s private interest is
detrimental or adverse to the interests of the Company as a whole. Examples of situations
involving a conflict of interest include but are not limited to: (i)&nbsp;conducting business with a
firm owned, partially owned or controlled by a director, officer, or employee or a relative of
such person; (ii)&nbsp;owning a financial interest in Alico&#146;s vendors, customers, or competitors
(ownership of less than 1% of the stock of a publicly traded company that competes or does
business with Alico is permissible); (iii)&nbsp;performing work, with or without compensation, for a
competitor, governmental or regulatory entity, customer or supplier of Alico, or doing any work
for a third party that may adversely affect your performance or judgment on the job or diminish
your ability to devote the necessary time and attention to Company-related duties; (iv)&nbsp;using
Company property, materials, supplies funds or other resources for personal purposes. These
situations and others like them, where loyalties to Alico could be compromised, must be
avoided. If you believe that you are involved in a potential conflict of interest, you must
discuss it with your supervisor and report it to our chief legal officer, to the Board of
Directors or to the Audit Committee of the Board.

Board of Directors of any reported conflicts or potential conflicts, including a statement as
to the resolution if any of such conflict. Conflicts that are unresolved or that otherwise need
to be considered by the Board shall be placed on the agenda for the next Board meeting. If the
potential conflict involves a member of Alico&#146;s Board of Directors, such member shall abstain
from participating in the resolution of such conflict by the Board or by any special committee
to which the Board may refer such matter. Disclosed conflicts of interest or potential
conflicts of interest will not be considered to violate our conflicts policy if and only if
Alico&#146;s Board less any member who may have a conflict of interest with regard to the matter
under consideration or a special independent committee of Alico&#146;s board to whom review of such
conflict has been referred, has determined that the activity which gives rise to the disclosed
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest is none-the-less in the best interest of
the Company and is fair to the Company and its stockholders.

Company has expressly decided not to attempt to take such opportunity;; (ii)&nbsp;make it possible

property, information or position when such opportunity could be of benefit or interest to the
