FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">WHEREAS, the Company desires to grant to the Participant, and the Participant accepts the grant of, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shares of Common Stock (the
&#147;Shares&#148;); </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">WHEREAS, the Company has duly made all determinations necessary or appropriate in connection with the grant of the
Shares hereunder. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, the parties hereto hereby

STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(a) <U>Grant</U>. As of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, the Company hereby grants and issues to the Participant,
and the Participant hereby accepts the grant of the Shares in such number as is specified in attached Exhibit A. Concurrent with the execution and delivery of the Agreement, the Company will cause the stock certificates representing the Shares to be
issued in Participant&#146;s name. To the extent the Participant hereby acquires the Shares and the Shares are not fully vested as of the date hereof, such Shares shall constitute &#147;Restricted Shares&#148; and shall be subject to all of the
restrictions described herein. Stock certificates representing Restricted Shares shall be held by the Company until such time as the Shares vest. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">(b) <U>Vesting and Settlement</U>. The Restricted Shares shall cease to constitute Restricted Shares, and shall become unrestricted Shares, pursuant to the vesting schedule attached as Exhibit A. </FONT></P> <P

<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">except in accordance with and subject to all of the terms and conditions of a Restricted Stock Award Agreement dated as of
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, a copy of which the Company shall furnish to the holder of this certificate upon request and without charge. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">When the restrictions on any Shares lapse, the Corporation shall cause a replacement stock certificate for those Shares, without the legend referred to
above, to be issued and delivered to Participant as soon as practicable. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>4. <U>Tax Consequences</U>. </B>The Company shall not be
liable or responsible in any way for any and all tax (including any withholding tax) consequences relating to the Shares, and the Participant agrees to undertake to determine, and be responsible for, any and all tax (including any withholding tax)
consequences to himself or herself with respect to the Shares. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Shares, shall not be released to the Participant unless, the Participant shall have paid to the Company, or made arrangements
satisfactory to the Company regarding the payment of, any Federal, state, local or foreign taxes of any kind required by law to be withheld with respect to the grant of the Shares or the lapse of restrictions otherwise imposed by this Agreement.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>5. <U>Section&nbsp;83(b) Election</U>.</B> The Participant understands that Section&nbsp;83 of the Code may tax as compensation income
the difference between the amount paid for the Restricted Shares, if any, and the fair market value of the Restricted Shares as of the date any restrictions on the Restricted Shares lapse in the absence of an election under Section&nbsp;83(b) of the
Code. In this context, &#147;restriction&#148; means the forfeitability of the Restricted Shares pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. In the event the Common Shares are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
&#147;Exchange Act&#148;), &#147;restriction&#148; with respect to the officers, directors, and 10% stockholders may also mean the six-month period after the acquisition of the Restricted Shares during which sales of certain securities by such
officers, directors, and ten percent (10%)&nbsp;stockholders would give rise to liability under Section&nbsp;16(b) of the Exchange Act. The Participant understands that he may elect to be taxed at the time the Participant receives the Restricted
Shares and while the Restricted Shares are subjected to restrictions rather than waiting to be taxed on the Restricted Shares when and as the restrictions lapse. The Participant realizes that he may choose this tax treatment by filing an election
under Section&nbsp;83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30)&nbsp;days from the date hereof and by filing a copy of such election with his tax return for the tax year in which the Restricted Shares were subjected to the
restrictions. THE PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS THE PARTICIPANT&#146;S SOLE RESPONSIBILITY AND NOT THE COMPANY&#146;S TO TIMELY FILE THE ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(B) OF THE CODE. A COPY OF SUCH ELECTION MUST BE FILED WITH THE COMPANY. THE
PARTICIPANT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE SHALL CONSULT HIS OWN TAX ADVISERS REGARDING THE ADVISABILITY OR NON-ADVISABILITY OF MAKING THE ELECTION UNDER SECTION 83(B) OF THE CODE AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE SHALL NOT RELY ON THE COMPANY OR ITS ADVISERS FOR SUCH
ADVICE. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>6. <U>Voting</U>.</B> Participant shall have the rights and privileges of a stockholder of the Company as to the Shares,
including the right to receive dividends and the right to vote such Shares. </FONT></P>
