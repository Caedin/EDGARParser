&#147;Company&#148;) is committed to conducting its business in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and in accordance with the highest ethical standards of business conduct. All of the Company&#146;s employees are expected to
conduct their activities and the operations for which they are responsible in accordance with such standards. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Additionally, this Code of
Ethics is established in order to comply with Section&nbsp;406 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, related rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;) and the listing standards for Nasdaq listed companies.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">This Code applies to all of our directors, officers, employees and agents, wherever they are located and whether they work for the Company
on a full or part-time basis. In addition, certain provisions specifically apply to the Company&#146;s principal executive officer and to the Company&#146;s principal financial officer, principal accounting officer or controller, or persons
performing similar functions (the &#147;406 Officers&#148;). We refer to all persons covered by this Code, including the 406 Officers, as &#147;employees.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

It is important for all employees to avoid not only conflicts of interest, but also the appearance of a conflict of interest. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If a
potential conflict of interest in the affairs of any employee either exists currently or arises in the future, it is the individual&#146;s responsibility to report details of the situation at once in order that the facts may be properly evaluated
and a decision made as to what, if any, action should be taken in connection with the matter. Should there be a question as to whether a conflict in fact exists, any doubt should be resolved in favor of assuming that there is a potential conflict
and the circumstances must then be reported in writing to the Compliance Officer. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Examples of potential conflicts of interest include

duties to, other entities, as employees, directors, consultants or otherwise. Such activities and duties generally do not in and of themselves constitute a conflict of interest, and in fact are valuable to the Company because of the experience and
perspective that outside directors offer to the Company as a result of these activities. Directors are expected to exercise sound judgment with respect to the relationship between their outside activities and their responsibilities to the Company,
and at all times to act in a manner consistent with their duties of care and loyalty, as well as other applicable legal standards governing the responsibilities of directors. Directors should err on the side of caution in disclosing to the Board
relationships that may constitute, or may appear to constitute, an actual or potential conflict of interest, and may be required to abstain from involvement as a Board member or as an employee, director, consultant or other affiliation with another
entity, in a particular matter. Outside directors also should fully disclose their relationship with the Company to other entities with whom they have a relationship. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

is endorsing the activity. Company personnel and assets are to be used solely for the business purposes of the Company. An employee must not use the Company&#146;s corporate name, any trademark owned or associated with the Company, any Company
letterhead, or any Company property, confidential information, resources, supplies or assets for personal purposes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

meals, entertainment or nominal gifts. While individual circumstances differ, the overriding principle concerning gratuities is not to give or accept anything of value that could be perceived as creating an obligation on the part of the recipient to
act other than in the best interests of his or her employer or otherwise taint the objectivity of the individual&#146;s involvement. It is the employee&#146;s responsibility to use good judgment in this area. All gifts and entertainment expenses
