STYLE="font-family:Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) considers the establishment and maintenance of a sound and vital management to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the
Company and its stockholders. The Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change of control may exist and that the uncertainty and questions which such possibility may raise among management
may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its stockholders. Accordingly, the non-management members of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) have determined that it
is imperative to be able to rely upon management&#146;s continuance and that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company&#146;s management, including you, to their
assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change of control of the Company. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

benefits described herein in consideration of your agreement to the arbitration provisions set forth in Section&nbsp;15 hereof. Upon the execution of this Agreement by you and the Company, it shall supersede any prior agreements in respect of the
