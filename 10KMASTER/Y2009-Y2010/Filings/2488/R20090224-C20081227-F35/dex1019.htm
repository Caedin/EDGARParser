declarations or similar documents, testifying or otherwise appearing at investigation interviews, depositions, arbitrations or court hearings and preparation for the above-described or similar activities. AMD will use its best efforts to ensure that
any assistance requested will be arranged so as not to interfere unreasonably with other employment or Employee&#146;s family commitments.&nbsp;AMD agrees to reimburse Employee for reasonable out of pocket costs Employee incurs in connection with
the foregoing, including but not limited to travel expenses, lodging expenses and other expenses incidental to such assistance, provided that such expenses are approved in advance by AMD. Employee agrees to submit reasonable documentation (receipts,

24 hours of receiving such notice. Employee, thereafter, agrees to cooperate with AMD and its attorneys in responding to (if necessary) such legal process. In that regard, Employee agrees not to testify or provide any information unless AMD first
consents to Employee&#146;s testimony in writing or&nbsp;AMD has informed Employee in writing that it has fully exhausted its efforts to challenge any request, subpoena or court order requiring Employee&#146;s testimony. If Employee is required to
provide testimony in any such context, Employee is, of course, expected to testify truthfully. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If, during the remainder of his employment with AMD or at
any time after the Separation Date, Employee is required to give testimony in any legal proceeding involving or relating to AMD, any of its customers, or his employment with AMD, AMD agrees to provide without expense to the Employee, and Employee
agrees to retain, AMD&#146;s outside counsel engaged in connection with the matter; provided,&nbsp;however, should there be an actual legal conflict of interest preventing such outside counsel from representing both AMD and Employee, then AMD shall
provide Employee substitute counsel of AMD&#146;s choosing. </FONT></P>

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Employee understands that Section&nbsp;1542 gives Employee the right not to release existing claims of which he is not now aware, unless he voluntarily chooses to waive this right. With this knowledge, Employee
nevertheless voluntarily waives the rights described in Section&nbsp;1542 or any other statute of similar effect, and elects to assume all risks for claims that may now exist in Employee&#146;s favor, whether known or unknown. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>14. Section&nbsp;409A.</B> To the extent applicable, this Agreement is intended to comply with Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended, and it shall be interpreted in a manner that complies with such section to the fullest extent possible. AMD and Employee agree that AMD shall, with Employee&#146;s written consent, have the power to adjust the timing or other details
relating to the payments described in this Agreement if AMD determines that such adjustments are necessary in order to comply with or become exempt from the requirements of Section&nbsp;409A. </FONT></P>

satisfied that he has been given sufficient opportunity to consider it. Employee has carefully read and understands all of the provisions of this Agreement. Employee understands that this is the entire agreement between him and AMD with respect to
this subject matter, and Employee represents that no other statements, promises or commitments of any kind, written or oral, have been made to Employee by AMD to cause Employee to agree to the terms of this Agreement. After the Separation Date,
Employee acknowledges and agrees that the Management Continuity Agreement by and between Employee and AMD, dated January&nbsp;12, 2007, shall be null and void. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
State of Texas and may not be modified, except by written instrument signed by both parties. If any clause, provision or paragraph of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable, such clause, provision or paragraph shall be deemed severed from the
