SIZE="2">1. <U>General</U>. This Outside Director Equity Compensation Policy (the &#147;Policy&#148;) is adopted by the Board of Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) in accordance with Section&nbsp;12 of the Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. 2004 Equity
Incentive Plan (the &#147;Plan&#148;). Capitalized but undefined terms used herein shall have the meanings provided for in the Plan. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">2.
<U>Board Authority</U>. Pursuant to Section&nbsp;12 of the Plan, the Board is responsible for adopting a policy for the grant of Awards under the Plan to Outside Directors (as defined therein), which policy is to include a written, non-discretionary
formula and also specify, with respect to any such awards, the conditions on which such awards shall be granted, become exercisable and/or payable, and expire, and such other terms and conditions as the Board determines in its discretion.

FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(i) <U>&#147;Off-Cycle&#148; Initial Grant</U>. On the date of an Outside Director&#146;s initial appointment to the Board that occurs other than on the date of an annual meeting of the Company&#146;s stockholders at
which Outside Directors are elected, such Outside Director shall be granted, automatically and without necessity of any action by the Board or any committee thereof, the number of Restricted Stock Units, or RSUs, granted pursuant to this Policy to
each Outside Director at the immediately preceding annual meeting of the Company&#146;s stockholders (the &#147;Initial RSU Grant&#148;). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">(ii) <U>Annual Grant</U>. The Board&#146;s practice is to provide annual equity compensation awards to its members the value of which is competitive with the value of equity compensation awards provided to the members
of board of directors of other technology based global companies. Based on analysis of competitive equity compensation grant practices that the Board has reviewed, Outside Directors are currently eligible to receive annual grants having a value
equal to $225,000, as follows: Provided that he or she has served as a member of the Board continuously for at least six months prior to such date, each Outside Director shall be granted, automatically and without necessity of any action by the
Board or any committee thereof, the number of RSUs, equal to the lesser of (A)&nbsp;the quotient of (i)&nbsp;$225,000 divided by (ii)&nbsp;the Average Fair Market Value of a Share on the date of grant (rounded down to the nearest whole number) under
the Plan on the date of the annual meeting of the Company&#146;s stockholders where such Outside Director is elected, beginning with the annual meeting of the Company&#146;s stockholders held in 2007 or (B)&nbsp;such number of RSUs as the Board may
determine based on such additional criteria as the Board considers appropriate to evaluate in its sole discretion, which criteria may include without limitation: business conditions and/or Company performance, outside director compensation practices
at the Company&#146;s then applicable peer companies and advice from and consultation with the Company&#146;s outside compensation consultant (the &#147;Annual RSU Grant,&#148; together with the Initial RSU Grants, the &#147;RSU Grants&#148;)).
