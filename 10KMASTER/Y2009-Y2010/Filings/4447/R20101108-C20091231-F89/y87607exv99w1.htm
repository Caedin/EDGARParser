</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to your request, we have conducted a reserves audit of the net proved crude oil,
condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and natural gas reserves, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, of
certain selected properties of Hess Corporation (Hess) to determine the reasonableness of Hess
estimates. Hess has represented to us that these properties account for 79&nbsp;percent on a net
equivalent barrel basis of Hess&#146; net proved reserves, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. We have reviewed
information provided to us by Hess that it represents to be Hess&#146; estimates of the net reserves, as
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, for the same properties as those which we evaluated. The report was completed
January&nbsp;15, 2010, but is being revised to add additional clarification requested by the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserves included herein are expressed as net reserves as represented by Hess. Gross reserves
are defined as the total estimated petroleum to be produced from these properties after December
31, 2009. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the
interests owned by Hess after deducting all interests owned by others, except in Russia, where Hess
owns 80&nbsp;percent of a consolidated corporate joint venture. As a result, Hess net reserves include
20&nbsp;percent of the Russian joint venture reserves not owned by Hess.
</DIV>
<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain properties in which Hess has an interest are subject to the terms of various profit sharing
agreements. The terms of these agreements generally allow for working interest participants to be
reimbursed for portions of capital costs and operating expenses and to share in the profits. The
reimbursements and profit proceeds are converted to a barrel of oil equivalent or standard cubic
foot of gas equivalent by dividing by product prices to determine the &#147;entitlement reserves.&#148;

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">These entitlement reserves are equivalent in principle to net reserves and are used to calculate an
equivalent net share, termed an &#147;entitlement interest.&#148; In this report, Hess net reserves or
interest for certain properties subject to these agreements is the entitlement based on Hess&#146;
working interest.
</DIV>









<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas reserves should be regarded only as
estimates. Such estimates are based upon information that is currently available and may change as
further production history and additional information become available. Such estimates are also
subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such
information.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data used in this audit were obtained from reviews with Hess personnel, Hess files, from
records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources. Additionally,
this information includes data supplied by Petroleum Information/Dwights LLC; Copyright 2009
Petroleum Information/Dwights LLC. In the preparation of this report we have relied, without
independent verification, upon such information furnished by Hess with respect to property
interests, production from such properties, costs of operation and development, prices for
production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and
various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination of the
properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report. In our opinion, the
adequacy and quality of the data provided to us was sufficient for us to conduct this reserves
audit.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hess net proved reserves attributable to these properties as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, and
which represent approximately 79&nbsp;percent of total Hess net reserves on a net equivalent barrel
basis, are as follows, expressed in millions of barrels (MMbbl), billions of cubic feet (Bcf), and
millions of barrels of oil equivalent (MMboe):

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the estimated net proved reserves prepared by Hess as shown in the table above
comply with the definitions and disclosure guidelines of Paragraphs 932-235-50-4, 932-235-50-6

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparing the detailed net proved reserves estimates by field prepared by us and by Hess,
we have found differences, both positive and negative, resulting in an aggregate difference of 3

us and referred to in the table above, when compared on the basis of net equivalent barrels, do not
differ materially from those prepared by us

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of standard geological and engineering methods
generally accepted by the petroleum industry. The method or combination of methods used in the
analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of
development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP)
and the original gas in place (OGIP). Structure and isopach maps were constructed to estimate
reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were
used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water
saturation. When adequate

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP or OGIP.
These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the
reservoirs, analyses of the fluid properties, the structural positions of the properties, and the
production histories. When applicable, material balance and other engineering methods were used to
estimate recovery factors. An analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate,
reservoir pressure, and gas-oil ratio behavior, was used in the estimation of reserves.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in
producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the
application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of
production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production or to
the limit of the production licenses as appropriate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petroleum reserves estimated by Hess and by us are classified as proved and are judged to be
economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions and assuming continuation of current regulatory practices using conventional production
methods and equipment. Reserves were estimated only to the limit of economic production rates under
existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective
date of this report, including consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by
contractual arrangements but not including escalations based upon future conditions.

12-month average price (reference price), calculated as the unweighted
arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month
within the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period,
unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements. The 12-month
average reference prices used were $61.18 per barrel for West Texas
Intermediate and $59.91 per barrel for Dated Brent. Hess supplied
appropriate differentials by field to the relevant reference prices and
the prices were held constant thereafter. The volume weighted average

was $4.19 per thousand cubic feet and the UK International Petroleum
Exchange reference price was $5.33 per thousand cubic feet. The gas prices
were adjusted for each property using differentials to NYMEX or the UK
International Petroleum Exchange furnished by Hess and held constant
thereafter. A portion of the gas reserves evaluated are in international
properties where the gas is sold based on contracted prices. The contract
was used to determine the gas price but inflation was not taken into
account in the calculation of the average price. The volume average
weighted gas price for all gas was $4.87 per thousand of cubic feet.

appropriate adjusted to reflect planned changes in operating conditions.
These costs were not escalated for inflation.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the regulatory environment by host governments may impact the operating environment
and oil and gas reserves estimates of industry participants. Such regulatory changes could include
increased mandatory government participation in producing contracts, changes in royalty terms,
cancellation or amendment of contract rights, or expropriation or nationalization of property.
While the oil and gas industry is subject to regulatory changes that could affect an industry
participant&#146;s ability to recover its oil and gas reserves, neither we nor Hess are aware of any
such governmental actions which restrict the recovery of the December&nbsp;31, 2009, estimated oil and
gas volumes.
