<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (this &#147;Agreement&#148;), dated as of the Grant Date specified
above, is entered into by and between Hess Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;),
and the Awardee specified above, pursuant to the Hess Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as
in effect and as amended from time to time (the &#147;Plan&#148;); and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it has been determined under the Plan that it would be in the best interests of the
Corporation to grant the restricted stock award provided for herein to the Awardee as an inducement
to remain in the employment of the Corporation (and/or any Subsidiary), and as an incentive for
increased effort during such employment;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises hereinafter set forth
and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby mutually covenant and
agree as follows:
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Compensation and Management Development Committee (the &#147;Committee&#148;) of the Board of
Directors (the &#147;Board&#148;) of Hess Corporation has granted to you restricted shares of the Common
Stock of the Corporation in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Plan and this agreement
(the &#147;Restricted Shares&#148;). The Restricted Shares are restricted for a period commencing on the
date of grant and ending on the third anniversary of the Grant Date and are otherwise subject to
the terms and conditions set forth herein. If the conditions set forth in the Plan and this
agreement are not satisfied, this agreement and the Restricted Shares awarded together with all
rights and interests relating thereto, shall be void and of no force or effect.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Incorporation By Reference; Document Receipt</B></U><B>. </B>This agreement is subject in all
respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, any amendments
thereto adopted at any time and from time to time unless such amendments are expressly not intended
to apply to the grant of Restricted Shares hereunder), all of which terms and provisions are made a
part of and incorporated in this agreement as if each were expressly set forth <U>mutatis
mutandis</U> herein. Any capitalized term not defined in this agreement will have the same meaning
as is ascribed thereto under the Plan. You hereby acknowledge receipt of a prospectus describing
the Plan and the Awards thereunder and that you have read it carefully and fully understand its

Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Restricted Stock</B></U>. Restricted Shares will be issued in book-entry form in your name
and deposited with The Bank of New York or other agent designated by the Committee, as escrow agent
(the &#147;Escrow Agent&#148;). Prior to the issuance and deposit of the Restricted Shares with the Escrow
Agent, you will have no rights of a shareholder, and you will not be entitled to vote the
Restricted Shares or receive any dividends or other distributions, in respect of the Restricted
Shares. The Restricted Shares will be held by the Escrow Agent pursuant to an agreement (the
&#147;Escrow Agreement&#148;) between the Escrow Agent and the Corporation. You authorize the Escrow
Agreement to transfer shares and otherwise act in accordance with instructions of the Corporation.
You will furnish the Escrow Agent with stock transfer powers or authorizations from time to time,
if requested. Except to the extent otherwise provided in the Plan or this agreement, if you remain
continuously employed by the Corporation or any Subsidiary until the third anniversary of the Grant
Date, the Escrow Agent will, except as provided below, deliver to you shortly thereafter a new
share certificate in your name representing the Restricted Shares; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that
Restricted Shares may nevertheless be evidenced on a noncertificated basis, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange. For as long as an account is
maintained in your name with a broker, custodian, or other institution retained by the Corporation
to assist in the administration of the Plan (the &#147;Administrator&#148;), such Restricted Shares will be
deposited into such account.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;</B><U><B>Rights as a Stockholder</B></U><B>. </B>While the Restricted Shares are held by the Escrow Agent,
you will be the record owner and will have all the rights of a stockholder with respect to the
Restricted Shares, including (without limitation) the right to vote, subject to the restrictions
provided for in the Plan, the Escrow Agreement and this agreement. From and after the date on
which the Restricted Shares are issued in your name and deposited with the Escrow Agent, cash
dividends and other distributions made or paid with respect to the Restricted Shares will be held
by the Escrow Agent and may (but need not be) reinvested as determined by the Committee, and such
dividends and distributions will be paid to you (or your account at the Administrator referred to
in Section&nbsp;2), together with interest or other earnings thereon (if any), at the time and to the
extent <U>pro</U> <U>tanto</U> that the Restricted Shares become non-forfeitable and are
delivered to you by the Escrow Agent. Any new, additional or different securities that you may
become entitled to receive with respect to the Restricted Shares under the Plan by virtue of any
reinvestment of any cash dividends paid on the Common Stock or any stock dividend, stock split,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, or any similar change affecting
the Common Stock, will be delivered to the Escrow Agent subject to the same restrictions, terms and
conditions as apply to the related Restricted Shares.

anniversary of the Grant Date by reason of your death, disability or normal retirement under the
Corporation&#146;s Employees&#146; Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto or any similar plan maintained
by a Subsidiary in which you participate, the Escrow Agent will, as promptly as practicable,
deliver to you, or your account at the Administrator referred to in Section&nbsp;2 (in the case of
disability or your normal retirement), or your beneficiary(ies) (in the case of your death) a
certificate representing all of the Restricted Shares awarded to you hereunder and all accumulated
dividends on the Restricted Shares, together with interest or other earnings thereon (if any). The
existence and date of disability will be determined by the Committee and its determination shall be
final and conclusive.

maintained by a Subsidiary in which you participate, all of the Restricted Shares, and any rights

Subsidiary terminates prior to the third anniversary of the Grant Date by reason of your early
retirement under the Corporation&#146;s Employees&#146; Pension Plan or any successor plan thereto or any
similar plan maintained by a Subsidiary in which you participate, the Committee, in its sole
discretion, may (but is not obligated to) determine that it will deliver to you, or your account at

proportionate number of the Restricted Shares awarded to you hereunder based on the number of
calendar days elapsed (as of the date of such early retirement) in the vesting period ending on the
third anniversary of the Grant Date, together with a proportionate amount of the accumulated
dividends in respect thereof also based on the number of calendar days elapsed (as of the date of

death. Such designation may be made by you on the enclosed beneficiary designation form and
(unless you have waived such right) may be changed by you from time to time by filing a new
beneficiary designation form with the Committee. If you do not designate a beneficiary or if no
designated beneficiary(ies) survives you, your beneficiary will be the legal representative of your
estate.

accumulated cash dividends in respect thereof or other amount in respect of this Award will be made
unless and until you (or your beneficiary or legal representative) have made appropriate
arrangements for the payment of any amounts required to be withheld with respect thereto under all
present or future federal, state and local tax laws and regulations and other laws and regulations.
Unless you elect otherwise in writing or are prohibited by law, upon expiration of the applicable
restriction period such number of Restricted Shares as shall be necessary to pay such withholding
amounts shall be sold by the Administrator on your behalf, and the proceeds thereof shall be
delivered to the Corporation for remittance to the appropriate governmental authorities, and the
remaining Restricted Shares shall be delivered to you, or your account at the Administrator

entered into by and between Hess Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), and the

effect and as amended from time to time (the &#147;Plan&#148;); and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it has been determined under the Plan that it would be in the best interests of the
Corporation to grant the stock option provided for herein to the Optionee as an inducement to
remain in the employment of the Corporation (and/or any Subsidiary), and as an incentive for
increased effort during such employment;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises hereinafter set forth

respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, any amendments
thereto adopted at any time and from time to time unless such amendments are expressly not intended
to apply to the grant of the option hereunder), all of which terms and provisions are made a part
of and incorporated in this Agreement as if each were expressly set forth <U>mutatis mutandis</U>
herein. Any capitalized term not defined in this Agreement will have the same meaning as is
ascribed thereto under the Plan. The Optionee hereby acknowledges receipt of a prospectus
describing the Plan and the Awards thereunder and that the Optionee has read it carefully and fully
understands its content. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the
terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.

Options will expire and no longer be exercisable upon the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date (the
&#147;Expiration Date&#148;).

(generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on
the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Common
Stock is then listed. Thus if the Expiration Date is not a trading day, then the last day the
Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the Expiration Date.

designated agent (who, for so long as the Corporation maintains a &#147;cashless exercise&#148; program and
the Optionee exercises and sells Option Shares through such program, shall be the administrator of
such program) on any business day (the &#147;Exercise Date&#148;) a notice, in such manner and form as may be
required by the Corporation, specifying the number of the Option Shares the Optionee then desires
to acquire (the &#147;Exercise Notice&#148;). The Exercise Notice will be accompanied by payment of the
aggregate Per Share Exercise Price applicable to such Option for such number of the Option Shares
to be acquired upon such exercise. Such payment will be made in cash, by personal or certified
check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Corporation or, if permitted by the
Committee (in its sole discretion) and applicable law, rule or regulation, by delivery of, alone or
in conjunction with a partial cash or instrument payment, (a)&nbsp;Shares already owned by the
Participant for at least six months, or (b)&nbsp;some other form of payment acceptable to the Committee.
To the extent permitted by law, the Committee may also allow the Optionee to simultaneously
exercise an Option and sell the Shares thereby acquired pursuant to a &#147;cashless exercise&#148;
arrangement or program, selected by and approved of in all respects in advance by the Committee.
Payment instruments will be received by the Corporation subject to collection. The proceeds
received by the Corporation upon the exercise of any Option may be used by the Corporation for
general corporate purposes. Any portion of an Option that is exercised may not be exercised again.

entered into by and between Hess Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), and the
Optionee specified above, pursuant to the Hess Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as in
effect and as amended from time to time (the &#147;Plan&#148;); and
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it has been determined under the Plan that it would be in the best interests of the
Corporation to grant the stock option provided for herein to the Optionee as an inducement to
remain in the employment of the Corporation (and/or any Subsidiary), and as an incentive for
increased effort during such employment;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises hereinafter set forth
and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby mutually covenant and
agree as follows:

respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, any amendments
thereto adopted at any time and from time to time unless such amendments are expressly not intended
to apply to the grant of the option hereunder), all of which terms and provisions are made a part
of and incorporated in this Agreement as if each were expressly set forth <U>mutatis mutandis</U>
herein. Any capitalized term not defined in this Agreement will have the same meaning as is
ascribed thereto under the Plan. The Optionee hereby acknowledges receipt of a prospectus
describing the Plan and the Awards thereunder and that the Optionee has read it carefully and fully
understands its content. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the
terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.

such Option (the &#147;Option Shares&#148;). The Options are not to be treated as (and are not intended to

acquisition of the Option Shares upon the exercise of any Option, neither the Optionee nor any
other person will become the beneficial owner of the Option Shares underlying the Option, nor have
any rights as a stockholder with respect to any such Option Shares and will not be entitled to
receive a cash payment or other distribution with respect to such Option Shares.

this Agreement, all Options not theretofore terminated will become exercisable as of the second
anniversary of the Grant Date.

Options will expire and no longer be exercisable upon the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date (the
&#147;Expiration Date&#148;).

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.3 </B>In no event will any Option be exercisable for a fractional share of Common Stock.

Expiration Date, the Options may be exercised to the extent exercisable until the close of trading
(generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on
the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Common
Stock is then listed. Thus if the Expiration Date is not a trading day, then the last day the
Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the Expiration Date.

whole or in part by the Optionee by delivering to the Secretary of the Corporation or his
designated agent (who, for so long as the Corporation maintains a &#147;cashless exercise&#148; program and
the Optionee exercises and sells Option Shares through such program, shall be the administrator of
such program) on any business day (the &#147;Exercise Date&#148;) a notice, in such manner and form as may be
required by the Corporation, specifying the number of the Option Shares the Optionee then desires
to acquire (the &#147;Exercise Notice&#148;). The Exercise Notice will be accompanied by payment of the
aggregate Per Share Exercise Price applicable to such Option for such number of the Option Shares
to be acquired upon such exercise. Such payment will be made in cash, by personal or certified
check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Corporation or, if permitted by the
Committee (in its sole discretion) and applicable law, rule or regulation, by delivery of, alone or
in conjunction with a partial cash or instrument payment, (a)&nbsp;Shares already owned by the
Participant for at least six months, or (b)&nbsp;some other form of payment acceptable to the Committee.
To the extent permitted by law, the Committee may also allow the Optionee to simultaneously
exercise an Option and sell the
Shares thereby acquired pursuant to a &#147;cashless exercise&#148; arrangement or program, selected by
and approved of in all respects in advance by the Committee. Payment instruments will be received
by the Corporation subject to collection. The proceeds received by the Corporation upon the
exercise of any Option may be used by the Corporation for general corporate purposes. Any portion
of an Option that is exercised may not be exercised again. Upon

entered into by and between Hess Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Corporation&#148;), and the
Optionee specified above, pursuant to the Hess Corporation 2008 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as in
effect and as amended from time to time (the &#147;Plan&#148;); and
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it has been determined under the Plan that it would be in the best interests of the
Corporation to grant the stock option provided for herein to the Optionee as an inducement to
remain in the employment of the Corporation (and/or any Subsidiary), and as an incentive for
increased effort during such employment;
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants and premises hereinafter set forth
and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties hereto hereby mutually covenant and

respects to the terms and provisions of the Plan (including, without limitation, any amendments
thereto adopted at any time and from time to time unless such amendments are expressly not intended
to apply to the grant of the option hereunder), all of which terms and provisions are made a part
of and incorporated in this Agreement as if each were expressly set forth <U>mutatis mutandis</U>
herein. Any capitalized term not defined in this Agreement will have the same meaning as is
ascribed thereto under the Plan. The Optionee hereby acknowledges receipt of a prospectus
describing the Plan and the Awards thereunder and that the Optionee has read it carefully and fully
understands its content. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the
terms of the Plan, the terms of the Plan will control.

Options will expire and no longer be exercisable upon the tenth anniversary of the Grant Date (the
&#147;Expiration Date&#148;).

(generally 4:00 p.m. New York time) on the last trading day falling within the exercise period on
the New York Stock Exchange or, if different, the principal stock exchange on which the Common
Stock is then listed. Thus if the Expiration Date is not a trading day, then the last day the
Stock Options may be exercised is the last trading day preceding the Expiration Date.

designated agent (who, for so long as the Corporation maintains a &#147;cashless exercise&#148; program and
the Optionee exercises and sells Option Shares through such program, shall be the administrator of
such program) on any business day (the &#147;Exercise Date&#148;) a notice, in such manner and form as may be
required by the Corporation, specifying the number of the Option Shares the Optionee then desires
to acquire (the &#147;Exercise Notice&#148;). The Exercise Notice will be accompanied by payment of the
aggregate Per Share Exercise Price applicable to such Option for such number of the Option Shares
to be acquired upon such exercise. Such payment will be made in cash, by personal or certified
check, bank draft or money order payable to the order of the Corporation or, if permitted by the
Committee (in its sole discretion) and applicable law, rule or regulation, by delivery of, alone or
in conjunction with a partial cash or instrument payment, (a)&nbsp;Shares already owned by the
Participant for at least six months, or (b)&nbsp;some other form of payment acceptable to the Committee.
To the extent permitted by law, the Committee may also allow the Optionee to simultaneously
exercise an Option and sell the Shares thereby acquired pursuant to a &#147;cashless exercise&#148;
arrangement or program, selected
by and approved of in all respects in advance by the Committee. Payment instruments will be
received by the Corporation subject to collection. The proceeds received by the Corporation upon
the exercise of any Option may be used by the Corporation for general corporate purposes. Any
portion of an Option that is exercised may not be exercised again. Upon
