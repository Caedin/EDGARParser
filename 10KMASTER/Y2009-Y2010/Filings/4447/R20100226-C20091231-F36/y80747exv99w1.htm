</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to your request, we have conducted a reserves audit of the net proved crude oil,
condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL), and natural gas reserves, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009, of
certain selected properties of Hess Corporation (Hess) to determine the reasonableness of Hess
estimates. Hess has represented to us that these properties account for 79&nbsp;percent on a net
equivalent barrel basis of Hess&#146; net proved reserves, as of December&nbsp;31, 2009. We have reviewed
information provided to us by Hess that it represents to be Hess&#146; estimates of the net reserves, as
of December&nbsp;31, 2009, for the same properties as those which we evaluated.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserves included herein are expressed as net reserves as represented by Hess. Gross reserves
are defined as the total estimated petroleum to be produced from these properties after December
31, 2009. Net reserves are defined as that portion of the gross reserves attributable to the
interests owned by Hess after deducting all interests owned by others, except in Russia, where Hess
owns 80&nbsp;percent of a consolidated corporate joint venture. As a result, Hess net reserves include
20&nbsp;percent of the Russian joint venture reserves not owned by Hess.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain properties in which Hess has an interest are subject to the terms of various profit
sharing agreements. The terms of these agreements generally allow for working interest
participants to be reimbursed for portions of capital costs and operating
expenses and to share in the profits. The reimbursements and profit proceeds are converted to a
barrel of oil equivalent or standard cubic foot of gas equivalent by dividing by product prices to
determine the &#147;entitlement reserves.&#148; These entitlement reserves are equivalent in principle to net
reserves and are used to calculate an equivalent net share, termed an &#147;entitlement interest.&#148; In
this report,

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of oil, condensate, NGL, and natural gas reserves should be regarded only as
estimates. Such estimates are based upon information that is currently available and may change as
further production history and additional information become available. Such estimates are also
subject to the uncertainties inherent in the application of judgmental factors in interpreting such
information.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data used in this audit were obtained from reviews with Hess personnel, Hess files, from
records on file with the appropriate regulatory agencies, and from public sources. Additionally,
this information includes data supplied by Petroleum Information/Dwights LLC; Copyright 2009

independent verification, upon such information furnished by Hess with respect to property
interests, production from such properties, costs of operation and development, prices for
production, agreements relating to current and future operations and sale of production, and
various other information and data that were accepted as represented. A field examination of the
properties was not considered necessary for the purposes of this report. In our opinion, the
adequacy and quality of the data provided to us was sufficient for us to conduct this reserves

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our opinion, the estimated net proved reserves prepared by Hess as shown in the table above

1202(a)(1), (2), (3), (4)&nbsp;and 1203 of Regulation&nbsp;S-K of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(SEC)&nbsp;and the reserves estimation methodologies employed are appropriate.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In comparing the detailed net proved reserves estimates by field prepared by us and by Hess,
we have found differences, both positive and negative. It is our opinion that the total net proved

referred to in the table above, when compared on the basis of net equivalent barrels, do not differ
materially from those prepared by us.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of reserves were prepared by the use of standard geological and engineering methods
generally accepted by the petroleum industry. The method or combination of methods used in the
analysis of each reservoir was tempered by experience with similar reservoirs, stage of
development, quality and completeness of basic data, and production history.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When applicable, the volumetric method was used to estimate the original oil in place (OOIP)
and the original gas in place (OGIP). Structure and isopach maps were constructed to estimate
reservoir volume. Electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, and other available data were
used to prepare these maps as well as to estimate representative values for porosity and water
saturation. When adequate
data were available and when circumstances justified, material balance and other engineering
methods were used to estimate OOIP or OGIP.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Estimates of ultimate recovery were obtained after applying recovery factors to OOIP or OGIP.
These recovery factors were based on consideration of the type of energy inherent in the
reservoirs, analyses of the fluid properties, the structural positions of the properties, and the
production histories. When applicable, material balance and other engineering methods were used to
estimate recovery factors. An analysis of reservoir performance, including production rate,
reservoir pressure, and gas-oil ratio behavior, was used in the estimation of reserves.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For depletion-type reservoirs or those whose performance disclosed a reliable decline in
producing-rate trends or other diagnostic characteristics, reserves were estimated by the
application of appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. In the analyses of
production-decline curves, reserves were estimated only to the limits of economic production or to
the limit of the production licenses as appropriate.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Petroleum reserves estimated by Hess and by us are classified as proved and are judged to be
economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating

existing economic and operating conditions using prices and costs consistent with the effective

regulatory environment. Foreign oil producing countries, including members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)&nbsp;may impose production quotas which limit the supply of oil
that can be produced. Generally, these production quotas affect the timing of production, rather
than the total volume of oil or gas reserves estimated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Changes in the regulatory environment by host governments may impact the operating environment
and oil and gas reserves estimates of industry participants. Such regulatory changes could include
increased mandatory government participation in producing contracts, changes in royalty terms,
cancellation or amendment of contract rights, or expropriation or nationalization of property.
While the oil and gas industry is subject to regulatory changes that could affect an industry
participant&#146;s ability to recover its oil and gas reserves, neither we nor Hess are aware of any
such governmental actions which restrict the recovery of the December&nbsp;31, 2009, estimated oil and
gas volumes.
